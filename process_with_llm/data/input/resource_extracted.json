The Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI ’s ECHO Center is the first site to replicate Project ECHO’s prison peer education program, launched in 2009 in New Mexico. Project ECHO, or Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes, is an innovative videoconferencing approach to sharing medical knowledge and training health care providers. IUPUI’s Indiana Peer Education Program ECHO graduated its first class of peer educators at Plainfield Correctional Facility, members of which proudly displayed their diplomas.

Childs Jr.Photo courtesy of the Fairbanks School of Public Health IUPUI’s Indiana Peer Education Program ECHO team, also known as INPEP, is training people who are incarcerated to become peer health educators. Graduates of the program can then pass on knowledge to their peers about common health conditions affecting prison populations, including infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, staph/MRSA skin infections and tuberculosis; mental health issues such as suicide risk, depression and anxiety; HIV and other sexually transmitted infections; diabetes; and addiction. These peer educators communicate strategies to reduce risky behaviors and serve as key resources for health information within the prisons, in addition to developing skills in self-efficacy, responsibility and leadership that can carry over into their lives after incarceration. Andrea Janota, program coordinator at the ECHO Center , said the Indiana Peer Education Program’s model is that “prison health is public health.” “Over 95 percent of people who are incarcerated will return to their home communities,” Janota said. “The Indiana Peer Education Program ECHO is a train-the-trainer model that provides an extraordinary opportunity to improve not only the health of people who are incarcerated, but also the health of their families and communities.” Twenty men from the Correctional Industrial Facility in Pendleton and the Plainfield Correctional Facility completed the 40-hour peer education training program in June and have begun hosting weekly health education workshops with their peers. Janota said the peer health educators are talented and energetic facilitators who are able to use their lived experiences to reach their peers in ways that those who have never been incarcerated cannot. In addition to supporting health and safety in prisons, the program provides trainees with much more than health education. “It provides the chance to be part of something, to be part of a community,” she said. “While the program prepares peer educators with a strong understanding of health topics and preventative measures, it also helps them develop a professional skill set that is applicable anywhere in the workforce.” The Indiana Peer Education Program is a collaboration between the ECHO Center at IUPUI, Step-Up Inc., the Indiana Department of Correction and the Viral Hepatitis Program at the Indiana State Department of Health. This project reflects Indiana University’s extensive expertise and research regarding addictions. To build on this area of strength, IU President Michael A. McRobbie, along with Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and IU Health President and CEO Dennis Murphy, announced the Responding to the Addictions Crisis Grand Challenge initiative in October 2017. Media Contact Richard M.

Program participants in 2020 are Carmel, Elkhart, Evansville, Fishers, Fort Wayne, Gary, Goshen, Michigan City, Richmond, West Lafayette and Zionsville. Building on the success of the 2019 Resilience Cohort , local governments will work with IU students and staff to identify actions, policies and programs to reduce emissions, an important step toward building community resilience against climate change. The Resilience Cohort program matches Hoosier communities with the tools, training and expertise needed to measure and reduce local greenhouse gas emissions. The program was launched in summer 2019 through a partnership between Sustain IU and the Environmental Resilience Institute , part of the IU Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative. Richmond, Indiana, is one of 11 Hoosier cities participating in Indiana University’s Resilience Cohort program to develop greenhouse gas reduction plans.Photo courtesy of Environmental Resilience Institute Last year, 14 local governments representing Indiana cities, towns and counties joined the Resilience Cohort program and completed greenhouse gas inventories for the first time. Before that, Indianapolis, Bloomington and South Bend were the only Indiana cities to have conducted greenhouse gas inventories of their own. Now local governments representing 35 percent of the state’s population have completed inventories using recent data. In 2020, cohort members will develop greenhouse gas reduction plans, also known as climate action plans, that outline specific activities the communities will undertake to achieve reduced emissions targets. The plans will then be presented to elected officials for review and approval by the end of the year. “We are thrilled that so many cities in the state have decided to take the important step of developing a climate action plan,” Environmental Resilience Institute Director Janet McCabe said. “Once adopted, these plans will provide a tailored roadmap for each community to address local sources of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. “In addition to lowering a community’s climate impact, implementing these plans will lead to immediate community benefits like green jobs, lower utility bills and improved air quality. Preparing a plan could even help communities with their bond ratings as ratings agencies start to take into account cities’ vulnerabilities to climate impacts.” As part of the program, eight of the cities will receive IU student externs through Sustain IU’s Indiana Sustainability Development Program. The summer externs will help local governments coordinate community input and prioritize reduction actions. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, causing air pollution and contributing to climate change. Some of the more common greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.Photo by Chaz Mottinger, Indiana University Cohort participants gain access to technical resources and training through ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability , a nonprofit organization that specializes in helping local governments with emissions management and climate action. The training will help each city set goals, forecast multiple greenhouse gas scenarios and engage community stakeholders before drafting a climate action plan. “Partnering with IU and its students has helped ICLEI to accelerate our work with local governments across the state,” ICLEI Executive Director Angie Fyfe said. “Many communities are committed to climate action but under-resourced, limiting their ability to move forward. The Resilience Cohorts are an excellent combination of technical and local know-how. This hands-on approach enables cities and towns to succeed in ways they otherwise could not.” Participation in the program has aided cities like Fort Wayne in their ongoing efforts to be a leader in climate response, said Doug Fasick, the city of Fort Wayne’s senior program manager for energy engineering and sustainability services. “Because of this program, the city of Fort Wayne completed a greenhouse gas inventory last summer,” Fasick said. “Now we’re beginning a process to work with the public to identify ways to reduce those emissions. Under Mayor Tom Henry’s leadership, we’re committed to doing more with renewable energy to help make a lasting difference for residents, neighborhoods and businesses in Fort Wayne.” Funding for the 2020 Resilience Cohort program is provided by the McKinney Family Foundation and the Duke Energy Foundation .

The survey was conducted as part of a collaborative research study between the IUPUI Sports Innovation Institute and the Westfield-based Grand Park Research Hub, part of the Grand Park Sports Campus. Their findings were recently published in the Sports Innovation Journal. Representing at least 13 different sports, a total of 10,359 people from 45 states completed the IUPUI research team’s entire survey. This photo was taken before social-distancing guidelines were implemented.Photo courtesy of Grand Park Sports Campus “As we look to see youth sports reactivate across America, it is critical that we understand the mindset and expectations of those intimately involved,” Westfield Mayor Andy Cook said. “To build confidence and ensure a safe return to sports, we need to know what is expected and how it aligns with health data.” “Grand Park is the largest youth sports facility in the United States. It makes sense that we, in partnership with the IUPUI Sports Innovation Institute, lead in this research,” said William Knox, director of the Grand Park Sports Campus . “In some cases, as we open back up, facility investments may or may not be expected. The information we have gleaned from this research is critical to event operators and organizations to create meaningful opportunities for athletes and their families to participate in sports again.” Led by David Pierce, director of the IUPUI Sports Innovation Institute and an associate professor of sports management in the School of Health and Human Sciences at IUPUI , the study assessed the feelings of parents, athletes, coaches, officials and administrators toward 12 adaptations being considered and implemented by venues for restarting youth sports programs. “COVID-19 has impacted all areas of life, and youth sports is no exception,” Pierce said. “Our study’s results provide youth sports facilities and event operators with data on how specific adaptations are received by stakeholders who are looking to return to youth sports in a timely but safe manner.” Among the study’s findings, participants identified seven critical or expected changes as youth sports emerge amid the pandemic: Venues and events should invest heavily and visibly in sanitization of facilities, playing areas and equipment – before, during and after events. Venue operators and event managers can feel confident that the recommendations provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Federation of State High School Associations to sanitize playing areas and equipment after each use will be well received and welcomed by users. Promotion and monitoring of social-distancing guidelines should take place. Personal contact between players should be limited. Admission should be limited to those under age 65 with no underlying medical conditions. It will be expected for users to complete a health and contact information questionnaire prior to entering venues in order for youth sports to return during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also found that parents of recreational athletes viewed the adaptations in a more positive light and as a more necessary part of the youth sports experience than did parents of travel athletes. Travel sports parents demonstrated an increasing comfort level in traveling for competitions over the summer months, from 42 percent in May to 76 percent in August. The survey was distributed to 40 youth sports organizations, which circulated the survey to their members. A total of 10,359 people from 45 states and representing at least 13 different sports completed the entire survey. Nearly 92 percent of respondents were parents, but with the option to select multiple roles, coaches (25 percent), administrators (10 percent), athletes (9 percent) and officials (3 percent) were also represented.

A free performance of the play will take place at 7 p.m. May 14 at the Phoenix.Photo by Tim Brouk, Indiana University Issues of discrimination experienced by African American women in Central Indiana are taking center stage – literally – as part of a collaborative project between an IUPUI researcher and an Indianapolis-based playwright. Sally Wasmuth, an assistant professor in the School of Health and Human Sciences, said she had been reading news and research studies that reported troubling statistics related to race and health care, suggesting biases held by health care workers could be contributing to negative health outcomes for African American women. She wanted to bring greater attention to health inequities faced by African American women in Indianapolis, so she partnered with Lauren Briggeman, the artistic director of a local theater company, to bring their stories to life. Wasmuth interviewed 10 African American women living in the Indianapolis area about discrimination they had experienced in different health care settings. Briggeman then took those interviews and wove them into a play that she wrote, directed and produced through Summit Performance Indianapolis, a local theater company focused on exploring the lives and experiences of women. The play, “Same Blood: Stories of Inequity from 10 Black Women Living in Central Indiana,” premiered May 7 at the Phoenix Theatre Cultural Centre in downtown Indianapolis. A second showing at the Phoenix Theatre will be free and open to the public at 7 p.m. May 14. After the performance, a short panel discussion will take place to talk about the play and answer questions from the audience. Indianapolis resident Sherry Harris, one of the 10 women interviewed by Wasmuth, said watching a play inspired by her experiences with discrimination was difficult, but she thinks talking about these problems more openly is a necessary step toward positive change. “I believe our community needs to hear this,” Harris said. “People want to turn around and say racism doesn’t exist. They don’t want to talk about it. They don’t want it to be a conversation. But it exists. I don’t know if it will ever change, but it exists.” Photos by Tim Brouk, Indiana University Wasmuth said that although she had planned to focus the interviews on health care inequity, discrimination was so prevalent in the lives of the women she talked to that her focus expanded to inequities found in multiple aspects of their lives, such as shopping at the grocery store, checking in at a doctor’s office or attending classes at a university. “I think it’s important to highlight how vast the problem is,” Wasmuth said. “The thing that I was struck by was how often and how constant and how pervasive experiences of discrimination were.” For some women, discrimination affected where they were looking to receive health care or from whom they were seeking health care services, she said. Other women actually worked in the health care system, so they were able to talk about experiences of discrimination not only as a patient, but also as a colleague. Briggeman said she hopes hearing these women’s stories as part of a theatrical performance will help community members connect with their struggles on a more personal level. “I think theater is the greatest creator of empathy,” Briggeman said. “What’s exciting to me is the honesty of each individual’s story, just being able to step back and hear that.” Wasmuth said a goal of the project is to spark community conversation and action that leads to improved health outcomes for African American women in Indiana. “One of the best ways that we can start to reduce some of these problems in our society is by unveiling what’s happening,” Wasmuth said. “By coming to this play, people will really get firsthand perspectives about things happening in our community right now, in 2019.” This project was made possible by a nearly $25,000 Trailblazer Award from the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute’s Community Health Partnerships program. It is part of Wasmuth’s ongoing research on population health and the use of arts-based initiatives to promote occupational justice.

Scheiber recently received funding to continue work with the Assiniboine people of the Northern Great Plains of North America to strengthen their language, Nakoda, by creating instructional materials, dictionaries and storybooks for use in reservation schools and households. Many of these materials pull from stories recorded by IU faculty in the 1970s and 1980s. Founded in 1985 by IU anthropology professors Raymond DeMallie and Douglas Parks, the American Indian Studies Research Institute has a long history of interdisciplinary research projects that attempt to fully understand and describe the language, culture or history of the native people of the Americas. In 2007, the institute launched a partnership with the Red Cloud Indian School in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, to create the first comprehensive Lakota language curriculum for K-12 schools. The success of these materials, coupled with decades of relationship-building and contact with the university, inspired leaders in the Assiniboine community to approach the institute about working together to create similar instructional materials for Nakoda. They hope that using the narratives told by tribe elders as the basis for the instructional materials will allow learners to not only reclaim the language but to more fully understand the Assiniboine worldview. Photos by James Brosher, Indiana University “Euro-Western ideologies of languages often treat them as just codes with referential value – you use it to label the world,” said Richard Henne-Ochoa, interim acting director of the institute. “In contrast, indigenous ideologies of language emphasize the relational aspect of language: how you relate to other people, how you relate to the environment, how you relate to the cosmos. All of these stories reveal that.” Mike Turcotte and Tuffy Helgeson, teachers in two Assiniboine communities in Montana who have been responsible for raising funding and leading the past two years of the project, consult with the team at IU during every step of the process. Turcotte and Helgeson recently visited campus, members of the institute’s team traveled to Saskatchewan to meet some community members, and the partners are in frequent contact via email and phone. Beyond informing the team about what’s best for their community, Turcotte and Helgeson provide insights and cultural nuances that the institute’s staff members may overlook. For example, Helgeson explained that the Nakoda word for Sunday is literally “holy day.” He said Assiniboine people believe every day to be holy, and labeling Sunday as the only holy day in a week – or having a name for days of the week in general – reveals the impact of Western and Christian worldviews. Helgeson has been aware of IU’s work with his tribe since he was a young boy and faculty were visiting the reservation to work with his grandparents. At first, he said, many members of his community were skeptical of the visitors’ motivations. But after years of trust-building and partnership, Helgeson said the work being done by the university is revered as essential. “Just in my lifetime, I’ve gone from being fully immersed in my language to having very few people I’m able to speak to,” Helgeson said. “The work we are doing with IU is building a foundation for the next generation, including my son who is in second grade, to be able to be fully immersed like I once was.” Jon Bowman, director of the Center for the Documentation of Endangered Languages at IU, pointed out the care the institute is taking to ensure that its Assiniboine partners are determining what will be most useful for their community. “If we just come up with a curriculum without their consultation, then it’s just more colonizing; it’s just repeating the old crime,” he said. “When it’s through their own elders’ old stories, that’s where they can hopefully get an idea of a worldview that simply isn’t available otherwise.” The process for transforming the field recordings into instructional materials starts with Bowman, who digitizes the recordings of the Assiniboine elders in his center’s lab. Many of these recordings have been transcribed by hand by DeMallie, who worked closely with native Nakoda speakers to develop a writing system for the spoken-only language. Linguists take these transcriptions, along with vocabulary collected by DeMallie, and enter them into a computer database. When recordi",

      "extracted_content": "First-of-its-kind online tool helps Indiana communities address climate change vulnerabilities Hoosier Resilience Index provides localized data for every community in the state For Immediate Release Nov 12, 2019 BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Indiana University’s Environmental Resilience Institute, part of the Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative, has launched the Hoosier Resilience Index , a first-of-its-kind online tool to help local governments and Indiana residents understand how their communities are vulnerable to climate change and what they can do to respond. The Hoosier Resilience Index infographic. An accessible version of this image is available online.Graphic by Samantha Thompson, Indiana University Drawing from publicly available datasets, the index places community-specific information at the fingertips of local leaders, providing data for every town, city and county in the state. The data include information about extreme heat and precipitation projections, flood plain and land use maps, and demographic information of vulnerable neighborhoods. The index helps local governments assess their readiness for environmental change and track community progress. By filling out a questionnaire, communities can score themselves and identify areas where they can work toward greater resilience. “Every Indiana community is facing challenges as a result of the environmental changes that are happening,” said Janet McCabe, director of the Environmental Resilience Institute . “Across the state, we will be seeing more days of extreme heat, heavy rain and flooding, but there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dealing with these impacts. The Hoosier Resilience Index puts local governments in control of their community’s future – not only showing every town, city and county the challenges they are likely to face in the years ahead, but also supplying a framework to help local officials assess community preparedness, prioritize the most important actions and make a plan.” Scientific evidence shows that the climate is changing in the Midwest, with average temperatures expected to increase by 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 and precipitation becoming heavier and more damaging in the winter and spring (and less frequent in the summer and fall). Most rural towns and small- to mid-sized cities do not have access to experts who can help them understand the direct implications of these changes, such as impacts to the local economy, housing and public health. The index draws from a wide range of federal and state datasets – including information supplied by the Indiana Climate Change Impacts Assessment, the U.S. Census Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency – to help communities plan for these risks. It is the first state-specific tool to package climate change information for local governments in this way. “One of the critical roles of municipal government is comprehensive and long-term planning,” said Matt Greller, CEO of Accelerate Indiana Municipalities . “I don’t think cities and towns in Indiana have ever had a tool like the Hoosier Resilience Index to look at environmental factors as an overlay into that planning process.” To design the index, the Environmental Resilience Institute consulted local officials across the state and worked with four “beta testing” communities. Local officials from less populous towns and counties, who sometimes struggle to find data relevant to their communities, were especially receptive to the index. “One of the strengths of the Hoosier Resilience Index is the fact that it is data based on my community,” said Denny Spinner, mayor of Huntingburg, a town of about 6,000 in southern Indiana. “There’s tremendous value in that, and I think that’s something that mayors across the state are really looking for.” To learn more about the Hoosier Resilience Index, register to attend webinars on Nov. 13 and Dec. 2. What they’re saying “As our environment changes and our relationship to it evolves, we know that we have to be ready. By both learning about how the environment is changing and examining our plans for these drastic changes, Noble County is actively preparing for change. The index is going to help us examine our plans and determine next steps based on our risk. Local governments across the state have been working on strengthening infrastructure and building more resiliently, and this tool helps provide support for these efforts.” – Kenneth Hughes, plan director of Noble County, Indiana “I think the tool will be a useful index for Hoosier communities and could be a model for other states to follow. The assessment questions forced us to look at the impacts so many of our local policies have on the environment around us, and the questions themselves helped us identify areas where we need to be better prepared for the impacts of climate change on our community.” – Jonathan Leist, town manager of Culver, Indiana “The Hoosier Resilience Index makes public data easier for community leaders to assemble and examine and provides a remarkable suite of information that is relevant to all of a community’s planning needs for anticipated climate change impacts. It will be an obvious springboard for action.” – Michael Hamburger, professor of earth and atmospheric sciences, IU Bloomington Prepared for Environmental Change The Indiana University Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative brings together a broad, bipartisan coalition of government, business, nonprofit and community leaders to help Indiana better prepare for the challenges that environmental changes bring to our economy, health and livelihood.

Indianapolis high school students participate in a previous year’s iDEW event.Photo by Tina Rice, School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI Established in 2015 by the School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI, the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce , or iDEW, program has launched the AT&T iDEW Summer Distance Program. This year’s activities, which run through Aug. 1, include Scrum training /project management certification, Code Black Indy -Salesforce project build-out training, Black Data Processing Associates-iDEW mentorship and a customized “speaking college,” as well as a virtual workshop in game and creature design taught by school faculty. In addition, students will be guided by trained IUPUI student mentors, who will encourage and support them along the way. iDEW provides free computing by design (CxD) support and instruction to students from eight area high schools – Pike, Providence Cristo Rey, Arsenal Technical, Herron, George Washington, Riverside, McKenzie Center for Innovation and Technology, and Southport – and has reached more than 1,680 students through its curriculum. The program, which recently completed its fifth year, has graduated 492 students, and over 90 percent are now attending college, 80 percent in STEM-related majors. Beyond completing learning modules in robotics, Internet of Things, trivia apps, chatbots/artificial intelligence, and video game design and data visualization, iDEW students are offered internship opportunities, visit IT industries, receive SAT prep assistance, and attend summer workshops and national IT conferences. In addition to building coding skills, students develop confidence and learn teamwork and communication. The AT&T iDEW Summer Distance Program is made possible by a $50,000 grant from the AT&T Foundation and will fund students’ participation in these summer technology workshops and trainings. “We are proud to support programs like IUPUI’s iDEW that are helping people from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds build the skills they need for successful careers in STEM fields,” said Bill Soards, president of AT&T Indiana. “The high school students participating in the program will become the future workers who help our world stay connected when we aren’t able to be together in person.” The summer program is also supported by a $10,000 grant from the Donaldson Foundation , the philanthropic arm of Donaldson Filtration Solutions, which has manufacturing or distribution sites in Anderson, Frankfort and Rensselaer. “We are excited and honored to contribute to the success of the iDEW program,” said Chini Zeman, a Donaldson Foundation board member. “Donaldson has a strong footprint in the greater Indianapolis community, and this program allows us to help support our community while aligning perfectly with our core charter of supporting educational opportunities for those who otherwise might not have them.” “We have grown the iDEW program in size and scope over the last five years,” added Mathew J. Palakal , senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing and program director for iDEW. “These grants give us needed resources to fund this unique opportunity to benefit underserved youth in the Indianapolis community during the summer months as well.” Author School of Informatics and Computing at IUPUI Joanne Lovrinic Explore media resources Filed under: Bicentennial Priority: A Commitment to Student Success Community Engagement Diversity IU Indianapolis Strategic Plan School of Informatics and Computing View all tags Plus sign More stories Global , Science and Technology A biologist’s journey into the field of volcanology News at IU May 5 Health and Wellness , Science and Technology New national center at IU to develop stem cell brain models to better understand Alzheimer’s disease News at IU July 31",

Four months ago, teachers were thrust into an online-instruction world with little training or preparation. With time a bit more on their side now, school leaders and teachers have a chance to discuss and strategize what online learning could look like in the fall semester – and the School of Education at IUPUI is helping to facilitate those conversations. A team from the School of Education at IUPUI held “virtual sharing sessions” with representatives of Central Indiana school districts, discussing experiences with remote learning last spring and plans for similar instruction this fall.Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University A team of faculty and staff held “virtual sharing sessions” with administrators and teachers from a number of Central Indiana school districts, discussing experiences with remote learning in the spring alongside concerns and plans for similar instruction in the fall. “What we really want to do is help the schools think through this – you can’t just take the classroom and put it online and expect it to work,” said Jeremy Price, an assistant professor in the School of Education specializing in urban education and technology in education. “This is a context-based, community-based approach.” The School of Education’s efforts will be enhanced by a $1,179,000 grant from the Indiana Governor’s Emergency Education Relief Fund to support educators and families through remote learning. The team, which includes Price, clinical associate professor Paula Magee, assistant professor Cristina Santamaria Graff, and marketing and communications coordinator Javier Barrera from IUPUI, plus associate professor Ted Hall of Martin University, identified five areas in which they can help educators strategize: Strengthening instructional practices during remote learning – that is, the content and goals of the instruction and how to transform it to the online setting. Providing digital learning resources and engagement strategies for families. Building administrative capacity. Supporting educator self-care, as traditional boundaries between work and home have been blurred by holding virtual classes. Preparing remote-ready future teachers in the event of future pandemics or catastrophes. “There’s a need for some external support as well as integrating technology into teaching,” Hall said. “It’s important to have teachers from a conceptual standpoint make the transition from face-to-face instruction to online while still being able to employ pedagogical strategies.” The team plans more sessions before school begins and is applying for grants through the Indiana Governor’s Emergency Education Relief – or GEER – fund, a component of the CARES Act, to further support the mission.

Melissa Fairbanks, director of the IUPUC Center for Business and Economic Development, said community members will have the opportunity to speak with one another on issues of diversity, inclusion and economic development rather than be fed information. Melissa Fairbanks.Photo courtesy of Melissa Fairbanks “After each of the three presentations, attendees will participate in breakout sessions to discuss key points and to interact with one another,” Fairbanks said. “Research has proven that diversity, equity and inclusion create more community engagement and higher productivity. Many studies have shown that when a diverse group of people makes decisions, the results are better and have a more far-reaching impact.” “Lead by Design: Unveiling the Bias” is partially sponsored by the Indiana University Council for Regional Engagement and Economic Development, which granted $2,500 from its Regional Economic Development Fund. What they’re saying The event speakers shared a brief summary of their presentations for the event. “In considering and adhering to feminist principles, we will be open to diversity and inclusion and be aware of – and continue to strive toward recognizing so we can mitigate – bias. A feminist workplace establishes a culture in which people feel valued and that they belong, and one in which we can attract and retain diverse people and ideas. We build and sustain a community when people feel heard and valued, and results show that people work harder and organizations are more successful when they attract and retain diversity in all its richness.” – Julie Goodspeed-Chadwick “I will present a process to help participants move forward with ideas to understand and manage unconscious bias. I’ll present four questions from the “design thinking” approach of Jeanne Liedtka and Tim Ogilvie to challenge participants to create actionable approaches to reduce the adverse impact of unconscious bias.” – Kevin Jones “Population growth is important to economic growth, and a significant percentage of Bartholomew County’s population growth over the past decade has come from people of color. Bartholomew County has room for improvement to retain people of color and continue to attract them. Many civic organizations in Bartholomew County – including not-for-profits and local government commissions – do not reflect the demographic makeup of our community. Women and people of colors are often underrepresented.” – Mark Stewart “We all have unconscious or implicit bias. Implicit bias can influence our decision-making in ways we don’t even realize. Knowing this, we can integrate measures to neutralize our biases before they translate into behavior and minimize the negative impact within our organizations.” – Marsha VanNahmen Explore media resources Filed under: Community Engagement Diversity IU Columbus View all tags Plus sign More stories Health and Wellness , Science and Technology New residency programs will train more primary-care physicians in southern Indiana News at IU July 14 Administration Trustees to meet June 12 at IU Bloomington News at IU June 9",

The Community Engagement to End Child Sexual Exploitation initiative connects IU faculty with state and local officials to address sex crimes against children. Eli Konwest, interim director of the Center for the Study of Global Change. Photo courtesy of the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies The IU Center for Rural Engagement, Eli Konwest and Teresa Nichols in the Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies’ Center for the Study of Global Change, and Deb Getz in the School of Public Health-Bloomington are partnering with Brown, Greene and Putnam counties to build multidisciplinary alliances, assess local assets, develop action plans and address specific community needs. Using evidence-based training and convening local, state, regional and national resources, this initiative will create coordinated, well-informed and well-equipped local teams in rural communities. Human trafficking and online child exploitation are difficult to measure in existing data sets, and Indiana does not currently have an inclusive state-level system for tracking this information. The Community Engagement to End Child Sexual Exploitation initiative will collect and examine data that will support local and state law enforcement’s analysis of these crimes. “As youth learn more about their immediate environment and learn that not everyone is living in a safe place, they become alarmed, with a desire to make things safer,” said Malea Huffman, extension educator for 4-H Youth Development in Greene County. “Our youth have incredible will and energy. The CEECSE project will help us better understand the current resources and needs to serve these youth and all within our community. Utilizing that needs assessment data to make our communities safe for all is a win-win.” Associate clinical professor Deb Getz meets in fall 2019 with her students in the Introduction to Lifespan Development class at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington, which collaborates with youth organizations in rural communities. Photo courtesy of the Center for Rural Engagement Human sex trafficking of children is defined as “a commercial sex act induced by force, fraud or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age.” Reported cases of human trafficking increased 84 percent in Indiana between 2015 and 2017. According to the National Human Trafficking Hotline, Indiana had 157 cases reported in 2019. Online child exploitation most commonly includes grooming, live streaming, possession, dissemination and production of child sexual exploitation imagery, and coercing and blackmailing children for sexual purposes. IU faculty and students will collaborate with the Alliance for Freedom, Restoration and Justice, a nonprofit humanitarian aid organization focused on supporting justice advocates and ending human trafficking, using the Engage Together Community Engagement Toolkit and accessible database. In combination with two training modules hosted by IU’s Public Health and You platform and a thought leader summit, the project will create a replicable model for other rural communities to implement in their own efforts. “Indiana’s children and their well-being are paramount, and we are committed to supporting community efforts to keep Hoosier children safe,” said Kerry Thomson, executive director of the Center for Rural Engagement. “With a multidisciplinary team at IU and dedicated local leaders and residents, we will strengthen safeguards and preventive measures that assist communities in ending abuse locally and across the state.” Media Contact Center for Rural Engagement Kyla Cox Deckard P: 812-855-4992 E: knblanke@indiana.edu Explore media resources Filed under: Center for Rural Engagement Community Engagement Hamilton Lugar School of Global and International Studies School of Public Health View all tags Plus sign More stories Administration , Health and Wellness IUPD becomes first unified higher education police agency to achieve accreditation News at IU June 23 Science and Technology IU-led nanoscience center drives innovation across industries with single-particle research News at IU August 15",

As a part of the Center for Urban Health at IUPUI ’s long-term effort to map lead levels across the city, organizers with the Indianapolis Ministerium ’s Faith Lead Initiative have begun to distribute lead test kits to residents on the near northwest side. The kits will provide participants with free, reliable lab results on potential lead exposure in their homes – information that is often out of reach due to barriers such as cost and lack of education on the risks of lead. The tests’ results will also contribute to anonymous public data on household lead levels across Indianapolis through the center’s Map My Environment website. This is the first time the website will contain data on lead levels in water. “There are regulations about the allowable amount of lead in water, but the truth is there’s no safe level of lead,” said Gabriel Filippelli , director of the Center for Urban Health and a Chancellor’s Professor at the School of Science at IUPUI. Filippelli’s expertise played a major role in a 2020 report on childhood lead poisoning from the Indiana Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. “It’s a neurotoxin that permanently impairs the brain, and you can see markedly lower IQ and higher ADD/ADHD in children who are lead poisoned.” The risks of exposure are especially serious in infants and toddlers. Also, “it’s been consistently found that lead testing rates are significantly lower in communities of color, even as the poisoning rate are significantly higher,” he said. Spencer Strout tests a water sample for lead content in a lab on the IUPUI campus.Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University In response to these inequities, the center’s testing effort will focus on homes in downtown Indianapolis between Kessler Boulevard and Meridian Street, from 16th to 38th streets. A second, larger phase of the project – open to residents across the state – is planned this summer. Also a leader on the project is the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute, whose partnership with the Ministerium began under the Anthropocene Household Project, an oral history project whose subject is residents of the city’s near northwest side. On April 8, volunteers at First Baptist Church North Indianapolis assembled the first 200 lead test kits for distribution in cooperation with local organizations such as GroundWork Indy, the Kheprw Institute, the Flanner House and partner churches of the Indianapolis Ministerium. Another 200 kits will be distributed in Muncie, Indiana, in cooperation with Ball State University. Each kit includes five plastic water vials, a large bag to collect household dust, three small bags to collect soil samples and informational material on lead in the home. A numbered sticker is used to keep samples anonymous. “Through the year of the pandemic, First Baptist Church North Indianapolis sought to discern what ministries are needed, and will be needed in the future,” said the Rev. Ivan Douglas Hicks, senior minster at the church. “We are currently working on projects that will provide needed resources in our area, which could be considered a resource desert.” Scientists are able to estimate the amount of lead in the water using a process known as anodic stripping voltammetry.Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University He said the lead testing project spoke to church leaders’ desire to provide leadership and programming to improve their members’ health. The fact that participants could learn about their home’s lead levels while keeping the home’s location anonymous was also significant, he said, as members were hesitant to pursue professional lead testing due to concerns about government repercussions. Another challenge is the fact that Indiana does not provide free home lead analysis until children test positive twice for elevated blood lead levels, Filippelli said. He said the state’s threshold for elevated blood lead levels – 10 micrograms per deciliter – is twice the amount regarded as elevated under national guidelines provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analysis of the test kit samples will be conducted by Spencer Strout, a student in chemistry and geology at the School of Science at IUPUI, under the guidance of associate professor Gregory Druschel . Earlier contributors to the project include Natalie Nichols, who graduated in fall 2020, and John Shukle, a Ph.D. student at the school. Shukle said the project’s focus on tap water is significant since lead contamination is most common in homes with aging infrastructure, such as lead pipes, which can lose the protective mineral layer that prevents heavy metals from leeching into drinking water. The collection kits include bottles for samples and informational material on the risks of lead in homes.Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University “The challenge is we’re not talking about a large amount of lead; it’s relatively low concentrations,” Strout said. “But once you get any lead in your body, the acids in your stomach dissolve it, and it gets in your bloodstream. And once it’s in your blood, it’s very hard to get out since it’s stored in your bones.” The collection effort builds upon previous work from the Center for Urban Health, which has offered free soil analysis since 2012 and free dust analysis since 2018 . The center had not been able offer free water testing until now because water collection requires special equipment compared to plastic baggies for dirt and soil. “There’s a wonderful citizen science aspect to this project,” said Jason Kelly, director of the IUPUI Arts and Humanities Institute. “Not only will the individuals who participate benefit directly, but the resulting data will also play a role in keeping communities safer more broadly.” This effort is supported by the IU Prepared for Environmental Change Grand Challenge initiative.

      "extracted_content": "Researchers seeking private well owners in 4 states for study of PFAS in well water For Immediate Release Jul 13, 2021 BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – A research team from Indiana University and the nonprofit research institute RTI International is seeking help from “citizen scientists” in four states for its study of a group of chemicals known as PFAS in private wells . The free testing kits for private well water are supported by a grant from the EPA.Photo by Getty Images Supported by a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency , the researchers will provide free testing kits to households in Washington, North Carolina, Indiana and Minnesota whose drinking water comes from private wells, enabling residents to collect and provide water samples for testing. PFAS is an abbreviation for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances , which have been used for about 80 years in common household products, particularly those that are stain- and water-resistant. They have been associated with numerous health problems, including high blood pressure, thyroid disorders and specific cancers. Because they do not easily degrade, they are often referred to as “forever chemicals.” “PFAS contaminants last a long time in the environment and have been found as far away as the North Pole, but we know very little about where and how often they occur in private well water,” said Jacqueline MacDonald Gibson, chair of the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the IU School of Public Health-Bloomington, who is principal investigator on the project. Amina Salamova, an associate scientist at the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, is co-investigator. “With 13% of the U.S. population getting their drinking water from private wells, filling this information gap is very important to making sure everyone has access to safe drinking water,” MacDonald Gibson added. Residents in Spokane County, Washington; Robeson County, North Carolina; Monroe County, Indiana; and Washington County, Minnesota, will receive postcards inviting them to participate in the study. The Washington, Minnesota and North Carolina counties were selected because each is the site of a major PFAS user or producer. Monroe County, Indiana, is included as a comparison to understand private well water vulnerability to PFAS contamination from scattered but common sources like septic tanks. Community leaders and residents of these four counties have been involved in study planning. Jacqueline MacDonald Gibson.Photo by James Brosher, Indiana University Unlike in the other communities, some residents of Washington County, Minnesota, are already eligible for free PFAS water testing by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency as part of the state’s legal settlement with 3M Corp. The settlement was reached in 2010 in response to state concerns that PFAS from 3M landfills had contaminated local water supplies. The IU-RTI research team is communicating with the state and with local governments in Minnesota, but the team’s study is independent of state and local agencies. Minnesota residents who participate in the IU-RTI study will still be eligible for state-provided water testing and response actions, such as access to bottled water, household water filters or city water connections. To learn more about the study and to inquire about enrolling, visit Clean Water for US Kids . Residents of the four communities may be eligible even if they did not receive a postcard from the research team. The researchers will notify selected residents by email, U.S. mail or phone. Selected residents will get a free water test kit with instructions on how to collect and ship samples, and they will receive personalized but confidential test results. “We really look forward to connecting with residents interested in participating as citizen scientists to identify PFAS in rural well water,” said Jennifer Hoponick Redmon , a senior environmental health scientist at RTI who is co-principal investigator on the study. “Our hope is that this research helps us better predict and communicate where PFAS exists in well water across the U.S.” Chamindu Liyanapatirana , an analytical research chemist at RTI, is also a co-investigator and will analyze water samples for PFAS using state-of-the-art methods. What the partners are saying: “This is a great opportunity for private well owners. These test results will either give residents peace of mind or the knowledge that action needs to be taken to ensure their home has safe drinking water.” – Mike LaScuola, environmental health specialist at Spokane Regional Health District. “Water is sacred to indigenous peoples and others who live here in Robeson County, North Carolina. Water is vital to tribal subsistence, cultural practices, health and welfare, agricultural production, and economic development.” – Beverly Collins-Hall , principal chief of the Cherokees. “We are pleased to partner with the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington to test private wells in the county for PFAS. Because we do not currently test for PFAS, this will allow us to provide more comprehensive service to the community.” – Penny Caudill, health administrator for Monroe County, Indiana. The results of this study “will improve the overall health of our area.” – Bill Smith, director of public health for Robeson County.

      "extracted_content": "AI chatbot to increase cultural relevancy of STEM lessons, engage marginalized students Oct 17, 2023 Indiana University researchers are developing a new chatbot that will make it easier for teachers to create more inclusive STEM activities — opening the door for marginalized students to engage in sustained STEM learning and STEM careers. The project, led by IU’s Jeremy Price and Sunandan Chakraborty , will leverage artificial intelligence to engage teachers in conversations about the best ways to adapt existing lesson plans and create new ones that are more inclusive and equitable for diverse students. Their work is supported by a one-year, $200,000 from the National Science Foundation. Evelyn Avalos, AJ Knoors and Sunandan Chakraborty are part of the team working to develop an AI chatbot that will assist K-12 teachers with making their STEM lesson plans more inclusive of all students. Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University. “STEM lesson plans in particular can be very difficult for teachers to make more culturally relevant for their students,” said Price, an assistant professor of technology, innovation and pedagogy in urban education at the School of Education at IUPUI and project director of the Collaborative for Equitable and Inclusive STEM Learning . “This chatbot will bring equity, inclusion and rigorous STEM to the forefront, providing important suggestions, pointers and resources to teachers to better engage with students, build a sense of community and prepare them for a life of STEM learning.” While the initial work is focused on K-12 teachers, the researchers hope students ultimately benefit the most. Introducing students to STEM learning activities that are relevant to them may get them more excited about future STEM learning and the various pathways it can lead them on in their lives and future careers. The researchers said this is particularly important for students of diverse backgrounds, who are often underrepresented in postsecondary science and engineering degrees. The researchers, including research assistants from Luddy’s M.S. in Applied Data Science program, will ensure the chatbot’s cultural sensitivity through community engagement. Building on the Collaborative for Equitable and Inclusive STEM Learning’s existing outreach and relationships in Indianapolis’ Near Eastside community, the chatbot will be trained using data from teachers and community members in the neighborhood who understand the importance of equity and inclusion in schools. The chatbot’s ability to offer a customized experience also makes it unique. “One of the chatbot’s most distinctive features will be its capacity to adapt and learn from the diverse backgrounds and preferences of users, tailoring interactions and activities with a high degree of context-sensitivity,” said Chakraborty, an assistant professor of data science in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at IUPUI. “This adaptive and personalized approach sets it apart, ensuring that it can effectively cater to the unique needs and characteristics of each participant.” The researchers will emphasize universal design to make the chatbot accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Additionally, they will build upon Chakraborty’s expertise with developing AI models and novel Natural Language Processing that can be used in real-world scenarios to develop more sophisticated, user-interaction-focused language models. To collect the necessary data to train the chatbot, affiliated faculty, staff and graduate students from the Collaborative for Equitable and Inclusive STEM Learning are beginning their work with the community this month. Focus groups will be convened to understand the ideas and aspirations that families and educators have for their students in STEM, with that input being used to train the chatbot. An early beta version of the chatbot will be ready for teachers to use within the next 12 months.

      "extracted_content": "Unity and university: IU provides roadmap for building Latino resource center in southern Indiana Feb 21, 2024 Board members of the Asociación Latineamericana del Sur de Indiana , or ALASI, in Dubois County knew that Latino residents in southern Indiana faced several barriers in their daily lives. To help quantify those barriers and how best to address them, the board turned to Indiana University for help. Dubois County celebrates the opening of the ALASI Resource Center. Photo courtesy of the IU Center for Rural Engagement ALASI board president Evelyn Rivas recounted her mother’s journey after fleeing war-torn El Salvador in 1987. “She faced many challenges, one being the language barrier,” Rivas said. “But she was fueled with hope that the United States could offer her what her country had not been able to.” Rivas said her mother worked two full-time jobs for several years, cared for their family and took English classes. “Even then she struggled to understand the culture, the traditions and the systems of her new home,” Rivas said. The county’s Latino community has been steadily growing for the past three decades. More than 9 percent of Dubois County residents identify as Latino, and in the Southwest Dubois County School Corp. in Huntingburg, 34 percent of students identify as Latino. In addition to hosting programs and social events in the Dubois County area, ALASI fielded daily questions about community resources, immigration assistance, child care needs and health care navigation. To name and quantify needs and barriers, ALASI turned to the Indiana University Center for Rural Engagement to conduct a needs assessment among Latino residents. The assessment identified the top-ranked needs as education, employment, child care, health, food and immigration support. “It was a very important document,” ALASI board member Rossina Sandoval said. “We know there is a need, but for the first time, we could prove that there is a need.” The ALASI board dreamed of a resource center where anyone could get support. ALASI again linked up with IU to make this vision a reality. Through the Center for Rural Engagement’s Sustaining Hoosier Communities program, adjunct instructor Trent Engbers and the IU O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs’ Online Master of Public Affairs program were ready to develop a plan. Students in the O’Neill Online Master of Public Affairs program come from around the world in late summer each year to participate in O’Neill Online Week in Indiana. Composed of working professionals, the O’Neill Online Week class unites decades of professional experience collectively. Before arriving in Indiana, students learn more about their partnering organization and its project alongside the public affairs experts at O’Neill. When they arrive, students begin the week in the partnering community, meeting with organization representatives and local leaders. They return to the IU Bloomington campus to develop their proposal, which they present to the community partner at the end of the week. Center for Rural Engagement healthy Hoosier communities liaison Mylan Gaston staffs a booth at the Hispanic Health Fair in Huntingburg. Photo courtesy of the IU Center for Rural Engagement “They get to know the people beyond an academic issue and understand the issue through the eyes of the client,” Engbers said. ALASI came to the O’Neill Online program with an overarching question: How can we better serve the growing Latino community in Dubois County? Before jumping into a resource center plan, the class quickly identified that there were two local Latino-serving entities: Latino-led ALASI and the Latino Collaboration Table, a consortium of corporate and governmental stakeholders. Inspired by this project and the recommendations of the class, the two organizations united under ALASI to bolster their strengths and better serve the community. “The class, ALASI and the Latino Collaboration Table started to think about what a more unified Latino-serving organization looked like, and that gave them a real impetus that had lasting impact,” Engbers said. The O’Neill class created a phased implementation plan for a brick-and-mortar resource center to ensure the community fully included Latino residents in local services, programs and opportunities. The first phase of the plan was focused on securing initial funding needed to fully open the center. “In simplest terms, it really created a roadmap for us to coalesce around,” ALASI board member Christian Blome said. “We have all these passionate people and resources in Dubois County, and this gave our mission validity.” The ALASI Resource Center opened its doors one year later on Sept. 15, 2023, with foundational support from German American Bank, OFS, Menke Foundation, Meyer Distributing/Meyer Logistics, Farbest Foods, Memorial Hospital, Kimball International, Old National Bank, Kimball Electronics Jasper and Springs Valley Bank & Trust; and through collaborations with the city of Jasper, city of Huntingburg and Southwest Dubois County School Corp. The board launched its search for the center’s inaugural executive director and appointed Joanna Howard to the role on Jan. 15. “Today we achieved what other communities with more manpower and more resources have not been able to do,” Rivas said at the Sept. 15 ribbon-cutting ceremony. “Today we show unity in advancing equity in our community and advancing cultural competence. Today we demonstrate that the diversity we have in our community is not only enriching us, but it is making our community stronger and better.” Located at 511 E. Fourth St. in Huntingburg, the center is focused on enhancing cultural competence by collaborating with community and service providers to facilitate access to health, housing and social services resources; promote education equity; and celebrate cultures. ALASI continues to implement the plan the O’Neill Online class developed, looking ahead to adding a liaison staff role and establishing a sustained funding model for the future. The board is envisioning new opportunities for ALASI to connect the Latino community with recreational, arts and cultural programs — all with future IU partnerships in mind. “This was hard work, but I can’t imagine where we would have been without the collaboration,” Blome said.

      "extracted_content": "Student-led project helps community make and distribute free masks Nov 3, 2020 A group of Indiana University Bloomington students who are passionate about promoting mask-wearing to stop the spread of COVID-19 are playing a key volunteer role in a community effort to provide people with masks. Nearly 80 Indiana University Bloomington students are part of The Mask Project at IU, which helps the Bloomington Mask Drive by making masks and helping with packaging, distribution and promotion.Photo courtesy of Arianna Smith The Mask Project at IU , involving nearly 80 students who are mostly on pre-medicine or pre-health tracks, has been helping Bloomington Mask Drive make, package and distribute masks since mid-September. They are free for any person who needs one and available at eight locations across Bloomington, including the Forrest Avenue entrance to Luddy Hall on the IU campus. Bloomington Mask Drive co-founder Kelly Clark said the contributions of the students cannot be overstated. “They will do anything we ask them for, and they can always fit it into their schedules, and they are so willing to help and so flexible,” she said. “They inject so much energy into Bloomington Mask Drive.” The community initiative started in March as a partnership between Clark, a physical therapist, and Nola Hartman, a member of the Bloomington Quilters Guild, and has resulted more than 38,000 masks made. Sophomore Arianna Smith said she cares about community health and felt a responsibility to get involved in the fight against the pandemic, so she started The Mask Project at IU. It was born out of a positive experience she had with a similar initiative earlier this year. After returning home to Crown Point, Indiana, in March, when the pandemic prompted IU to send students home and shift classes to online instruction, Smith volunteered with NWI Masks. The initiative in Northwest Indiana provided personal protective equipment to essential health care workers. When Smith returned to IU in the fall, she wanted to do something similar here. An online search for local mask initiatives revealed the Bloomington Mask Drive. Smith contacted Clark, and they discussed how IU students could help. That prompted Smith to create The Mask Project at IU. IU sophomore Arianna Smith started The Mask Project at IU, which promotes a mask-wearing culture through its “My Mask Matters” campaign.Photo courtesy of Arianna Smith Smith used social media to attract students to her project, which is primarily focused on assisting Bloomington Mask Drive. The students sew, sort and package the masks. They deliver materials to those who sew masks and take finished masks to the distribution locations. They also promote Bloomington Mask Drive on Instagram. “It’s been the most valuable experience I’ve had in my life,” Smith said. Marlee Vinson, a sophomore and neuroscience major, said she wanted to play an active role in ending the pandemic, and helping with a mask initiative was one way to contribute. “In my opinion, wearing a mask is an act of love to those around you; it’s like saying, ‘I see you, and I’m trying to protect you’ to every single person you come in contact with,” Vinson said. She’s sewn masks, sorted them, tested the elastics, packaged masks, prepared the distribution bags and distributed masks. “This makes me feel that I am making a difference in the community,” Vinson said. Sophomore Lenna Gottschild joined The Mask Project at IU because she had been wanting to make masks since the start of the pandemic and saw it as an opportunity to learn the mask-making process. She also likes that the project benefits the greater health and community of Bloomington. “Getting to spend a few hours a week socializing and doing something productive does good to the soul,” Gottschild said. The Mask Project at IU also has a campus initiative called “My Mask Matters.” Other IU students are asked to write on a white board why their mask matters and a social media post is created, all to promote a mask culture on campus and foster empathy, Smith said. “We are a group of students who care about wearing masks and promoting safety on and off campus,” Smith said. Luddy Hall on the IU Bloomington campus is one of eight distribution locations for face masks made by the Bloomington Mask Drive.Photo courtesy of Kelly Clark That care also is demonstrated by some IU employees who have volunteered with Bloomington Mask Drive, and helped secure Luddy Hall as a distribution location. Benita Brown and Lynne Mikolon, who both work in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering , and are experienced at sewing, started making masks for Bloomington Mask Drive in March. “Making fabric masks lets me be creative and helpful,” Brown said. “Having an interesting mask might just encourage people to wear them, which is beneficial to all of us.” Clark said Brown and Mikolon approached Jill Clancy, an event planner for the Luddy School, about using the building as a place to distribute masks. “Luddy is a great place to have masks available on campus so that anyone can come by and pick one up,” Mikolon said. Clancy, who helps by buying and cutting fabric for Brown and Mikolon, worked with Bloomington Mask Drive to establish Luddy Hall as a distribution point. Near the entrance sits a large self-serve box – painted by Clancy – with the masks and signage, as well as information about Bloomington Mask Drive. It also has slots for monetary and fabric donations. “It’s worked really well so far,” Clancy said. Kell Mirowski, a Bloomington Mask Drive volunteer who works part-time for IU in the College of Arts and Sciences, has helped Clark by leading coordination efforts with The Mask Project, allowing Clark to return to patient care at her clinic.

      "extracted_content": "Senior food insecurity connected to isolation, program barriers in rural areas IU study also reveals a concerning increase in loneliness among seniors due to the pandemic For Immediate Release Nov 16, 2020 BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – As food insecurity rises among older adults in the United States, a new study from Indiana University is uncovering factors that prevent older residents from accessing the food they need. Little research has been done to understand how lower-income older adults manage to meet their food needs – or don’t – especially in rural areas. The IU study, conducted by the Sustainable Food Systems Science Initiative in partnership with the IU Center for Rural Engagement , relies on 10 public discussions in fall 2019 held in Crawford, Greene, Lawrence and Orange counties to learn more about food provisioning methods – the ways that seniors “make do” with the food resources they have. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Lost River Market and Deli in Paoli, Indiana, has launched multiple initiatives to serve fresh, local produce to seniors and those managing chronic illnesses. Photo by Eric Rudd, Indiana University To further assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food provisioning, the research team also surveyed 5,000 households in lower-income census tracts across Crawford, Greene, Lawrence and Orange counties during April, May and June 2020. Seniors who participated in the discussions and survey reported that living alone decreases their motivation to prepare balanced meals and reduced joy from eating. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated those feelings, the survey found, significantly increasing seniors’ feelings of loneliness, making them feel left out and isolated. While 23 percent of those surveyed felt “left out” often or sometimes before the pandemic, 40 percent felt so after it began. Similarly, 7 percent felt “isolated” often or sometimes before the pandemic, but 61 percent felt so after the pandemic started. And while 25 percent felt they “lacked companionship” often or sometimes before the pandemic, 42 percent felt so after. “The jump in loneliness indicators with the onset of the pandemic was perhaps the most concerning finding,” said Dan Knudsen, professor emeritus in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Geography, and affiliate faculty with the Critical Food Studies Laboratory at the IU Food Institute and the Center for Rural Engagement. “The sharp increase in feelings of isolation may speak to a need for a concerted mental health push this winter, a season that is bad generally for seniors, and with the prospects for a ‘twindemic’ may be devastatingly so.” In contrast, seniors who live with children and/or grandchildren explained that sharing in shopping and cooking routines and eating together with families helped them to eat better. “Congregate meals, like those offered at senior centers or churches, where people can share a meal and engage socially with others, are hugely appreciated by the seniors we interviewed,” said project partner Phil Stafford of Commons Planning Inc. “However, many communities have seen these meals dwindle, and even regular meal services like Meals on Wheels have reduced deliveries to frozen meal packs twice a month in some areas.” Transportation is another major barrier to food access for older rural residents who no longer drive. Public buses are few or non-existent, rural transit is limited, and Medicaid cab services will provide rides only to a medical appointment for those who qualify. Seniors rely on family members, neighbors and friends for rides, but they sometimes cannot afford what a driver might ask them to chip in. A ride-share network could offer access and cost-effective opportunities for seniors, the researchers suggest. For older residents who are watching their budgets or on fixed incomes, it is typical for food to rank as a lower priority than rent, utility and medical payments. Seniors navigate food assistance programs including local food pantries and food box drops, but residents interviewed reported that the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, commonly known as food stamps) is complicated and limited to about $13 to $15 per month in benefits on average, pre-COVID-19. “SNAP and other programs often involve paperwork that discourages participation given the low benefit amounts, the costs of getting to welfare offices, and perceptions of need and eligibility,” said Angela Babb, assistant scientist at the Ostrom Workshop, director at the Critical Food Studies Laboratory and faculty affiliate at the Center for Rural Engagement. As a nutritionally vulnerable population, seniors have distinct food needs to manage health conditions such as renal disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure or cholesterol. They are often prescribed foods low in sodium, sugar or phosphorus or high in potassium or calcium, which are largely not available to them through food programs. The survey indicated that those who struggled with food security before the COVID-19 pandemic continued to do so, and those who were food secure largely remained food secure. However, food provisioning strategies changed significantly. In the case of food sources, there was a dramatic decline in the reliance on restaurants and food directly received from farmers, and a corresponding increase in provisioning from grocery stores and supermarkets, delivery services and relatives, friends and neighbors. The frequency of provisioning also declined, from multiple times per week and weekly to biweekly and monthly food provisioning. The research team will continue to analyze the survey results in the coming months as they begin the third phase of analysis to gain additional insights into regular food provisioning routines among food-insecure seniors in the region. The study will conclude in summer 2021 with a series of workshops to devise strategies to relieve food insecurity among senior citizens in the region. This study is part of the IU Center for Rural Engagement’s efforts to improve the health and resilience of Indiana’s rural communities and develop replicable initiatives for communities across the nation. Additional funding for the COVID-19 pandemic survey came from the IU Office of the Vice President for Research.

IU teacher candidates and School of Education staff volunteers are offering free virtual tutoring for K-12 students across the state starting this week. The service will continue until Thanksgiving. Tyna Hunnicutt, the co-director of clinical experiences and director of early field experience in the School of Education, said the one-hour Zoom sessions will be available twice a week for a K-12 student who has signed up for the service. “I had students reaching out to me asking if there were ways that they could help kids in the community,” Hunnicutt said. “We decided that we would work toward offering a tutoring program.” Tyna Hunnicutt. Photo courtesy of Tyna Hunnicutt One-hundred and thirty families have signed up for the virtual tutoring through the School of Education’s Facebook page. Since so many families have signed up, it has taken time to match IU students and volunteers with the K-12 students and plan the logistics, Hunnicutt said. “We try to place based on whether they are interested in elementary or secondary,” Hunnicutt said. The IU student and staff volunteer tutors have a variety of backgrounds. They have been divided up into three tutor groups and matched with a K-12 student based on the students’ study needs. “The first 63 placements that we sent are early field experience students who are mostly going into education,” Hunnicutt said. “The next set of tutors will be taking one of their elementary literacy courses. Then, they are becoming elementary teachers. The rest of the placements will be volunteers from the School of Education.” Hunnicutt said all the college tutors are excited to get started and are thrilled to be giving back during a trying time in education. Taylor Belleville, a senior studying secondary English education, said she plans to move to Chicago after graduation and hopes to work in the Chicago Public School system in a ninth- or 10th-grade classroom. “I think that tutoring is definitely going to help me be a better teacher in the future,” Belleville said. “It is such an important skill to have, because in our future as educators, we will definitely have students who need individualized help.” Free, virtual K-12 tutoring officially starts next week and will run through Thanksgiving. Photo courtesy of Tyna Hunnicutt The Avon, Indiana, native said she’s seen how much students are struggling with e-learning, because she has four younger siblings who are still in secondary school. She hopes programs like the free virtual tutoring will help bridge the gap so that when things go back to face-to-face classes, it’s not as hard to catch all of the students up on what they might have missed. “Teachers can’t do everything and commit 100 percent of their time to helping students, so hopefully having this program will take a little of the pressure back off of them,” Belleville said. Although registration for fall tutoring is closed because of the huge turnout, Hunnicutt said her goal is start up another virtual tutoring session next semester. “Helping kids is what I have always wanted to do as a teacher, so it’s really special to be able to get the program rolling,” Hunnicutt said.

Chuck Aikman, content systems leader for IU Digital Campus Studio, and Sharon Aikman, a registered nurse at IU Health, have been foster parents for 14 children and are in the process of adopting their fifth child. Chuck Aikman, pictured, and his wife, Sharon, have delivered more than 50,000 weekend meals to food-insecure students at three Ellettsville schools.Photo by Chris Meyer, Indiana University That love and care extend to children outside their home, too. The nonprofit food pantry they operate from their house provides meals to about 50 students at three schools in Ellettsville so they don’t go hungry over the weekend. They have operated Backpack Blessings for seven years, and they make weekly deliveries to Edgewood High School, Edgewood Junior High and Seven Oaks Classical School. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the deliveries have been no-contact drop-offs at the schools. “The idea is to provide two full meals and some snack food, and the hope is they get one full meal at home,” Chuck Aikman said. “Even if they don’t, there is enough food to sustain them during the weekend.” Each student receives: Two servings of cereal. Two additional breakfast items. Two fruit cups. A sleeve of crackers. Two pudding cups. Two main meals (chicken noodle soup, beef stew, ramen noodles, for example). Two fun snacks (fruit snacks, beef sticks, for example). Juice boxes. Shelf-stable milk. The students and their families also receive special Thanksgiving and Christmas meals. Thanksgiving is a turkey with the trimmings, and Christmas is a ham with the trimmings. Backpack Blessings is the result of God opening their eyes to the need, the Aikmans said. Sharon Aikman, left, got the idea for helping food-insecure students through her participation in a women’s Bible study.Photo courtesy of Chuck and Sharon Aikman Sharon Aikman was involved in a women’s Bible study of the book “Radical” in the spring of 2013 and said it challenged her to examine her life and think about needs that are overlooked every day. She said it reminded her of an episode of Oprah Winfrey’s TV show where she took backpacks of food to students in inner-city schools who faced food insecurity. Sharon said she talked to Chuck about providing food for local students in need, and he embraced the idea. “I was on board right away,” Chuck said. “We’ve always had a heart to be willing to help.” “Our heart is for children,” Sharon said. Sharon spoke to the superintendent for Richland-Bean Blossom Community School Corp. at the time and asked if any students needed help with meals over the weekend. “The superintendent said, ‘I have been praying for eight years that somebody would do this. There is an incredible need,’” Sharon said. Seven Oaks Classical School, a charter school, began receiving help from Backpack Blessings in 2019. The schools tell the Aikmans how many students need food, the Aikmans and volunteers organize the bags of food and make the deliveries, and teachers distribute the food. In seven years, Backpack Blessings has provided students with more than 50,000 meals, the Aikmans said. “It’s really been a phenomenal effort that started with five little church ladies,” Sharon said. Those who have been helped by Backpack Blessings or supported it have expressed their gratitude for the Aikmans’ efforts.Photo courtesy of Chuck and Sharon Aikman The Aikmans do whatever is necessary to ensure that nutritious food arrives at the school, and they never have limited the number of families that receive assistance, Edgewood High School Principal Dirk Ackerman said. “The Backpack Blessings program is a tremendous opportunity for many of our neediest families,” Ackerman said. “Many of the students that benefit from the program would go weekends without nutritious meals.” Backpack Blessings receives food and monetary donations, as well as volunteer support, from the Monroe County community, in addition to the Aikmans’ contributions. Chuck said one goal is to secure 12 community partners each year who are willing to support with donations for one month each. Some IU employees who have supported Backpack Blessings with money or food said the Aikmans’ selflessness and compassion drive their effort to fight food insecurity among children. “The thing that most impresses me is they both work full-time jobs and have their own family to take care of,” said Jennifer Mitchner, adjunct and e-text coordinator in the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs. “And this is not just a one-time annual event for them; this is a passion that they live and provide as an ongoing year-round lifestyle. And nothing of personal gain except the joy and satisfaction of bettering a child’s life.” Anna Lynch, group manager for eLearning Design and Services at IU, connected with Chuck Aikman through University Information Technology Services and discovered they both have a passion for service, although in different areas. “The Aikmans have put a tremendous amount of energy into making sure kids in Monroe County don’t go home for the weekend without enough to eat,” Lynch said. “I think a lot of us don’t realize how many families struggle to put enough food on the table. This isn’t just a far-away problem; it is really, truly happening to families that we all interact with in our community.” Lynch said she supports Backpack Blessings through networking and word-of-mouth promotion, introducing people to the food pantry as a resource and explaining its mission. “One thing we have seen at IU and locally is that almost everyone cares about food security,” she said. “Everyone wants to do their part once they hear about the need and the efforts. It’s distressing that the need is so great, but it’s inspiring that the effort to fill that need is so strong.” Author IU Newsroom Kirk Johannesen Communications Consultant, Strategic Communications P: 812-855-2193 E: ktjohann@iu.edu Explore media resources Filed under: Community Engagement Inside IU Bloomington Paul H.

They will discuss activism then and now for civil rights, social justice, inclusion and equality, offering pathways to build a world more reflective of King’s dream. “I am thrilled with this partnership and the opportunity to bring these two legendary activists together for a moderated dialogue answering questions about what has changed, what remains the same and the future of social justice in America,” said James C. Wimbush , IU vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural affairs; dean of The University Graduate School; and Johnson Chair for Diversity and Leadership at Indiana University. The program will offer a first-time dialogue by the two internationally recognized leaders, who will discuss their social activism process, their experiences, and connecting generationally to current social justice and equality issues. Moderating the dialogue will be Angela Rye. A prominent political strategist offering on-air commentary, she also serves on boards of the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, Congressional Black Caucus Political Action Committee and the Seattle University School of Law Alumni. Rye has served as Executive Director and General Counsel to the Congressional Black Caucus for the 112th Congress. Immediately following the panelist discussion, there will be a community conversation with local leaders. This conversation will highlight lessons learned and further discuss where we as a community go from here, regarding social justice and racial equity. Moderator for the community conversation will be Karen Vaughn with Radio One Indianapolis. Local panelists are: David W. Greene, Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, President Jessica Louise, Indy 10 Black Lives Matter Organizer IPS Advisory Council Student Lemuel Warren Watson, Indiana University Davis, a distinguished professor emerita of history of consciousness and feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is the author of 10 books. A lecturer known for powerful speeches and dialogue about injustice, she has been involved in social justice movements worldwide. Garza is co-creator of #BlackLivesMatter and the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which now has 40 chapters in four countries. She serves as the strategy and partnerships director for the National Domestic Workers Alliance and is co-founder of Supermajority, a new home for women’s activism. Her activism involves health issues, student services and rights, rights for domestic workers, ending police brutality, anti-racism, and violence against transgender and gender non-conforming people of color. “Combining efforts to host this event in honor of Dr. King speaks to the importance of organizations coming together to create partnerships that take them beyond the ordinary to create the extraordinary,” said Madam Walker Legacy Center board chair Joyce Q. Rogers. “This year’s MLK Day of Celebration shines a spotlight on decades of advocacy and activism in American history to move beyond injustice for some to justice for all. Esteemed beyond the timeline of their combined experiences, we are poised to receive a powerful message with solutions for change. When we ask ourselves ‘What has changed,’ this dialogue provides a stark reality that brings it all into focus.” To register or to learn more about this event, visit the Madam Walker Legacy Center website or IU’s MLK Celebration site.

Christine Skaggs. Photo by Lauren Kay-Beason, IUPUI Christine Skaggs, a graduate student in chemistry at the School of Science at IUPUI, was recently named the Global Outreach Volunteer of the Year by the American Chemical Society, or ACS. The honor, which recognizes “the immeasurable efforts made by volunteers from ACS local sections and international chapters to conduct outreach and teach the public about chemistry,” cites Skaggs’ work as the secretary of the Indianapolis section of ACS as well as her work as chair of COVID-19 Chemistry Kits for Kids, which distributed resource kits including masks, hand sanitizers and winter accessories to more than 200 students from underserved populations in Indianapolis. Of the 36 outreach volunteer awardees this year, Skaggs was the only individual selected for the special honor of ACS Global Outreach Volunteer of the Year. “ACS allows me to bridge my two passions, which are chemistry and outreach,” Skaggs said. “We want to be able to provide resources to those who need them, and it’s very rewarding to be able to give back, even if it’s in a small way.” COVID-19 Chemistry Kits for Kids was conducted in partnership with the American Chemical Society; Asphalt Materials; the Bruker Corporation; Butler University; Corteva Inc.; Eli Lilly and Co; The Heritage Research Group ; Hotel Tango; IUPUI; the IUPUI Graduate Student Chemistry Society, MOLE; the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers; and the University of Indianapolis. Skaggs worked with Linda Osborn, a senior project chemist at the Heritage Research Group, to coordinate contributions from these organizations across the city. From left: IUPUI students Courtney Cruse, Carolina Vega and Mikayla Metzger assemble COVID-19 Chemistry Kits for Kids on the IUPUI campus. Photo courtesy of Christine Skaggs The kits contained reusable, custom-sized masks; hand sanitizer; snacks; activity booklets with crayons; a hand-washing demo; hats and gloves; a folder with resources on COVID-19 for parents; water bottles; Post-It notes; pencils; keychains; stress balls; goggles; and soap. Assembly took place over the course of two days in July at the Science Building on the IUPUI campus. School of Science graduate students Courtney Cruse, Kymeri Davis, Mikayla Metzger, Lauren Mehok, Ashur Rael, Carolina Vega and Hannah Zimmerman were among the volunteers. The kits were then transported to Heritage Research Group, a privately held, family-owned environmental services business located near Eagle Creek in northwest Indianapolis, whose volunteers distributed the kits in the community in October. The overall response from the community was overwhelming, and we were able to double the number of kits we assembled due to the support from our sponsors,” Skaggs said. “The encouragement this project was given made me proud to call Indianapolis my home; I wanted to give back to a city that has given so much to me.” Skaggs is also the founder of ACS Indiana’s Senior Chemists Mentorship Program , which connects senior chemists with younger scientists, and she has been actively involved in the annual Celebrate Science Indiana festival. The full list of awardees is published in Chemical and Engineering News. Winners were also recognized during the annual ChemLuminary Awards ceremony , which took place virtually Dec. 9.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense funded the AI pilot program, which will begin this summer. NSWC Crane is teaming up with two IU schools: the School of Education and the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering , both at IU Bloomington. NSWC Crane and IU received the National Defense Education Program Award to pilot the program, titled AI Goes Rural: Middle School Artificial Intelligence Education, to Indiana middle schools. Tina Closser, the science, technology, engineering and math program coordinator for NSWC Crane, said the program will focus on how AI is involved in students’ lives and the ethics surrounding AI. “The expertise that IU is bringing to the AI Goes Rural program is exciting, and we are thrilled to have them as a partner to bring this curriculum to regional students,” Closser said. “People, including kids, think AI is alien and science fiction. They don’t realize how it is already integrated into their lives. “AI is a hot topic right now, and it is more than Netflix and Spotify curating movies or music for the user. This pilot program is unique; I’ve never seen anything like this. There’s a lot out there about the technical side of AI and how it works, but we will be talking about what AI does and how it affects their lives.” Jeff Zaleski, interim vice provost for research at IU Bloomington, said he is pleased that IU is continuing its strong partnership with NSWC Crane. “The involvement of the faculty from two of our schools points to IU Bloomington’s deep strengths in areas related to artificial intelligence, and the application of this expertise to the lives of rural Hoosier students is especially exciting,” Zaleski said. “To pilot this program, many letters of support were received from across the Department of Defense, including the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, U.S. Special Operations Command and U.S. Central Command. The letters make note of the critical importance of developing the AI talent pipeline. Raj Acharya , associate vice president for research for AI innovation at IU, said the AI Goes Rural curriculum is designed to help students understand what AI can and cannot do. “We will educate students on AI and machine-learning techniques by designing modules that students will experiment with under varying conditions,” Acharya said. “This will help them understand not only the potential of routine AI methodologies used, but also their limitations such as bias and ethical considerations.” Closser said the curriculum and training are intended to be scalable across the nation, with broad applications. “We wanted to create something that anyone around the country can implement, copy and paste,” she said. A report from the Committee on STEM Education of the National Science and Technology Council said that investing in STEM education and outreach is critical for several reasons: The demand for STEM professionals will exceed the expected supply over the next decade; our nation’s students are “‘middle of the pack”’ when evaluated against other countries; and participation and achievement of underrepresented groups such as women and minorities are lower than desired. The STEM talent pipeline is part of the Department of Defense’s STEM Strategic Plan and includes promoting an “increased participation of underserved groups in STEM activities and education programs.” Closser said this and several other factors led to the development of this program. “As our STEM team and IU were in the brainstorming process, we considered the rural, underserved area,” Closser said. “There’s a large percentage of students that attend Title I schools in the area, or schools that under the Department of Education have high numbers or high percentages of children from low-income families. “We have talented people in the area, but the number seeking STEM degrees isn’t high. We have an opportunity through this program and programs like this to show kids what options they have and what they can do as a career.” The AI Goes Rural team members include Closser and Alison Smith of NSWC Crane; Kyungbin Kwon, Anne Leftwich and Krista Glazewski of the IU School of Education; and Acharya and Mehmet Dalkilic of the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering.

Free computer science workshops for public school teachers will be taught over the next two summers by School of Informatics and Computing faculty at IUPUI.Photo courtesy of the School of Informatics and Computing The summer Computing by Design Teachers Training Program is being offered to more than 300 Indiana educators over the next two summers. Starting this fall, Indiana law will require computer science coursework to be offered in all Indiana schools. “Having computer science taught across grade levels and schools provides Hoosier students greater access to this growing, problem-solving field,” Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner said. “As schools across the state have expanded their computer science offerings, partners like the IU School of Informatics and Computing have played an important role in training our educators to prepare our students with the skills and knowledge needed for the future.” The Computing by Design program, launched in 2019, prepares teachers to be able to offer computer science classes at their schools. Last summer, the first year the workshops were offered, 112 teachers participated. “The need for professional development in computer science continues to rise quickly,” said Jim Lyst, a School of Informatics and Computing faculty member and curriculum lead of the Computing by Design program. “At the same time, the unique context for every teacher and school demands an adaptable pathway to preparing successful coursework. This year, we are offering several workshop options for teachers to choose from, regardless of their background and experience in computer science.” Computing by Design, also known as CxD, is a professional development experience for teachers in all instructional areas who are expected to teach courses or offer activities in computer science. The program curriculum has been successfully implemented through the school’s popular Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Program, now running in eight high schools. Participants will be taught by School of Informatics and Computing faculty, focused on developing lesson plans in computer science that follow a Computing by Design-based teaching and learning format. “The key innovation and the tremendous success of the Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce Program has been developing and implementing the CxD curriculum in teaching computing concepts in high school computer science classes,” said Mathew J. Palakal, senior executive associate dean of the School of Informatics and Computing. “This approach instilled interest – specifically in IT, and in STEM broadly – among high school students. We are excited that the IDOE has recognized the CxD approach as being a successful model to adopt and expand to school teachers in Indiana who are engaged in teaching computer science classes.” Offerings include: Six programming workshops (trivia, chatbot, robot, video game, internet of things and data visualization). An innovation workshop. A project-based-learning 101 workshop. Six cross-discipline workshops with projects that blend computer science into business, language arts, math, art and more. While the workshops will be largely conducted online, allowing for greater flexibility of time, regular live Zoom meetings will be scheduled and materials, including videos, will remain available after the workshops for further self-guided review. Teachers will have access to School of Informatics and Computing faculty for remote technical assistance during the training and throughout the academic year using a web-based workspace. In addition, standalone computer science activities for all grades, but with an emphasis on kindergarten through Grade 8, will be developed during the summer and through next year and made available online.

      "extracted_content": "Social work students answer the call as frontline telephone crisis workers during pandemic May 27, 2021 Indiana 211, a free service that connects Hoosiers with local resources 24/7, had been fielding an average of 20,000 calls a month in early 2020. IU MSW Direct student Ashley Asante-Doyle conducted her practicum at Indiana 211 remotely, using only a laptop and headset to deliver critical health and safety information to Hoosiers during the pandemic. Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University But when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the U.S., that number quickly jumped to 20,000 calls a day from people seeking coronavirus-related information and help with lost wages, evictions, food insecurity and other challenges stemming from the pandemic. Almost immediately after this unprecedented rise, Indiana University School of Social Work students were on the frontlines. Starting in March 2020, 29 students from the school – 28 pursuing a master’s degree in social work and one pursuing a bachelor’s degree – have worked at Indiana 211 as part of the practicum requirement for their degrees. “It’s easy to forget, but Indiana 211 was a first responder to the pandemic in Indiana, before we even understood the disease or if there was hope for a vaccine,” said Erika Galyean , an associate clinical professor for the Master of Social Work program at the IU School of Social Work, who arranged for students to serve at Indiana 211. “Every time there was a new announcement about changes in local laws or public health practices – such as social distancing, masking, getting a test, or even whether it was safe to go to work – the state would direct people to 211,” said Galyean, who also provided field instruction to the participating students. “They were getting hundreds upon hundreds of calls from employers and citizens, nearly overnight.” IU’s partner on the collaboration is Jaimie Ferren, deputy director of Indiana 211 at the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration . She and Galyean knew each other through Galyean’s role as a member of the state’s Resiliency and Emotional Support Team, a volunteer team that provides mental health support to first responders in crisis and disaster events, including workers at Indiana 211. After an initial conversation, Galyean said it became clear the IU School of Social Work was in a position to help address the sudden shortage in telephone crisis workers needed to serve the huge increase in callers. The partnership was also beneficial to students, many of whom had abruptly lost their social work field placements due to the pandemic. Such placements are a requirement for degree completion, but thanks to the Indiana 211 partnership, no student who accepted an alternate placement with 211 had to extend their graduation date. Moreover, since the call-center work occurred remotely, MSW students from four IU campuses – IUPUI, IU Bloomington, IU Northwest and IU South Bend – as well as students in the MSW Direct online program , were able to participate. Ashley Asante-Doyle. Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University “Indiana 211 crisis calls challenged me daily,” said Ashley Asante-Doyle, an MSW Direct student who worked at the service until the end of last year. “Hearing some of the stories broke my heart; I had some disgruntled callers and some emergencies … but overall, the experience was awesome. I decided to pursue a career in social work to help others, and working at Indiana 211 allowed me the opportunity to assist.” In addition to questions about COVID-19 tests and mask wearing, Asante-Doyle said she fielded questions about food insecurity; the federal eviction moratorium; assistance with car payments and monthly utilities; shelter; mental health services; and requests to be placed in a facility to quarantine. Students working with the call center choose a time to log in between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., with shifts running four hours. Calls start immediately, running back to back. During a typical shift, Ferren said a person could handle about 25 calls. “Indiana 211 really is vital to the state of Indiana,” Asante-Doyle said. “Without it, Hoosier families wouldn’t be able to access resources to carry them over or assist during an emergency. It’s also a great opportunity for organizations to get their resources into the community.” In addition to the IU School of Social Work, Ferren said Indiana 211 received support from other local nonprofit and government agencies, as well as contact tracing staff from the Indiana Department of Health. To coordinate during calls, Asante-Doyle would communicate with fellow workers through an online group chat. Indiana 211 also split students between various service lines focused on specific topics. MSW students most commonly worked lines for COVID-19 inquiries, such as clarifications about public restrictions and later vaccine access, as well as a line for rental assistance. To supplement the students’ field experience, Galyean incorporated topics relevant to their Indiana 211 work into the classroom, such as discussions and readings on crisis intervention work, as well as practicing coping skills to combat “compassion fatigue.” Students were also asked to identify journal articles on crisis intervention topics and compare the research to their own experiences. “I loved working with the students from the IU School of Social Work,” Ferren said. “They were all eager for new experiences and knowledge, and provided great insight and feedback, which we’ve been able to incorporate into our work.” Among other things, Galyean said students conducted an employee survey on inclusivity and diversity, which resulted in recommendations to improve training on these topics. Another group conducted a “customer satisfaction survey,” following up with people who were helped by the call center. But Asante-Doyle said that what stood out the most for her was supervisors’ willingness to provide constructive feedback, as well as the faculty’s willingness to listen to students about their experiences. She also said she and her fellow students stayed in contact outside practicum hours to provide feedback or encouraging words. Although no IU students are currently answering calls at Indiana 211 during the summer sessions, Galyean said the partnership has been so successful that Indiana 211 will become a permanent practicum site for IU, with MSW students returning for fall practicum placements in August.

This photo of The Black Market in Bloomington, Indiana, which was firebombed on Dec. 26, 1968, is an example of the historical information found on the interactive digital timeline that explores “The Making and Unmaking of Black Wealth in the United States.”Photo courtesy of IU Archives ” Land, Wealth, Liberation: The Making and Unmaking of Black Wealth in the United States ” is an interactive timeline with photos, videos, historical information and resources for educators covering 1820 to 2020. The project explores the ways African Americans in the U.S. have produced wealth, and the factors that have affected their ability to build and maintain wealth and access economic opportunities. To launch the digital timeline, IU Libraries, IU’s Institute for Advanced Study and the Center for Research on Race and Ethnicity in Society at Indiana University will host a roundtable conversation at 6 p.m. March 24 at the Lilly Library. The event will feature two speakers. Valerie Grim , professor of African American and African Diaspora studies in the College of Arts and Sciences at IU Bloomington, will present on “Struggles in Building Black Wealth.” Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman , a scholar, activist and author who will give the 2022 Branigin Lecture for the Institute for Advanced Study, will speak about “Race and Gender in the Economy.” Registration is required to attend , and a virtual option is available. A pop-up exhibit will open at 5 p.m. March 24 and run for the duration of the event. Registration is not required for the pop-up exhibit. Willa Tavernier , IU Libraries’ research impact and open scholarship librarian, said the national dialogue in 2020 around racial justice after several high-profile killings, and disparities such as the wealth gap and social class, sparked the idea for the project, which she and other IU librarians have led for more than a year. “A lot of people didn’t understand the origin of the wealth gap,” she said. “I would say even at the beginning of the project, even my understanding of it did not stack up to what I found. Historically, there has been so much destruction and targeting of Black communities and wealth that’s more widespread than I realized.” Tavernier said she wanted to create a widely relatable exhibit that sparks discussion and brings history to light in a freely accessible way. Because she wanted scholarly sources to be the basis of the information, she sought assistance from several librarians in early 2021: DeLoice Holliday , multicultural outreach librarian and head of the Neal-Marshall Black Culture Center Library; Ursula Romero, Lilly Library public services librarian; and Christina Jones , head of the Education Library. A photo of an illustration from the 1945 pamphlet “Hemmed In: ABC’s of Race Restrictive Housing Covenants,” written by Robert C. Weaver.Photo by Ursula Romero, IU Lilly Library Holliday provided information about Black Wall Street communities and material on Black wealth. Romero assisted with unique primary sources from the Lilly Library. Jones and student employees at the Education Library created lesson plans that could be used by educators outside IU. “It is very important to educate others of the various places around the country that were destroyed by bands of violent people who used intimidation, trickery, fraud and, in many cases, eminent domain to upend Black communities around the country,” Holliday said. The 200-year timeline is broken into five time periods, starting with the pre-Civil War era, and each illustrates the forces and policies at work in those periods. Included are events such as the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre in Oklahoma, when about 300 people were killed and 35 city blocks burned, and actions and policies that hampered Black Americans’ ability to own land or homes. Undergraduate and graduate students were hired to help the librarians research and write for the digital exhibit. Working on the project was an eye-opening experience. Savannah Price, a history and gender studies major from Kentucky, worked on the technology platform’s accessibility. She went through the Associated Press report “Torn from the Land” and organized material about how land was taken away from African Americans. She said some of the things she learned have been “a lot to reckon with.” “One part of it that really stood out to me was seeing names of towns that my friends are from, where Black people were systemically run out of those towns in Kentucky,” Price said. “There was one town that was flooded to form Kentucky Lake, so the town’s entire history is under water. I didn’t know there were white people in that town who made sure there were no Black people in the whole county. They would give them a warning to leave and then burn down their houses if they didn’t.” Rihona Bing-English, a master’s student in the School of Social Work, examined the history of reparations and the first and second Morrill Acts that created land-grant universities. Learning this history, which she helped add to the timeline, has been difficult and at times hurtful, Bing-English said. “Growing up in Bloomington, Indiana, a predominantly white community, I had zero information on these policies and history,” she said. “I’m finding out about this now and processing it as an adult.” MarQuis Bullock, who is pursuing a master’s in library science with a specialization in archives and records management, worked with Tavernier on much of the initial research to determine what to include in the exhibit. He said growing up in Little Rock, Arkansas, there was a conscious effort at his school to make sure Black children knew Black history, but reading some of the documents during his project research still made for some tough moments. “You think about what the past could have been and the future could have been if there had not been civilian and political obstruction preventing African Americans from gaining economic, financial and social independence,” Bullock said. “You couldn’t help but to think where we could have been as a society in general had we been allowed to contribute equally to the construction of not just wealth, but the country’s wealth, and the country’s health as well.” Tavernier said she hopes the launch of the “Land, Wealth, Liberation” project is just a first step, and that IU faculty will see it as an opportunity to present research and information on related topics. “Our hope is this won’t be a static exhibit, but that faculty at IU with an interest in an area can build on the content,” she said. “The impact will probably be realized in the ways faculty, students and researchers use the resource,” Holliday added.

      "extracted_content": "IU students lead health education programs across South Bend region Jun 16, 2022 Two semesters isn’t much time to research, plan and implement multiple new public health initiatives from the ground up. Yet that’s what 32 students at IU South Bend did during their senior year – and what up to 40 do every year – as part of a course that caps the educational experience for students in the dental hygiene program and health promotion concentration of the BS in Health Sciences in the Indiana University South Bend Dwyer College of Health Sciences. Caylee Gee, left, and Yasmin Leal, right, dental hygiene students at IU South Bend, discuss oral health with fourth graders from Richmond Elementary School at an afterschool program hosted by the Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph County. Photo courtesy Caylee Gee and Yasmin Leal, Indiana University The two-semester course, led by Mallory Edmondson , a clinical assistant professor and director of the Division of Dental Education at IU South Bend, is required for students’ professional accreditation as dental hygienists. But it’s also an important path to understanding their power to instill healthy habits in their clients. “Dental hygiene students are typically very focused on clinical work and gaining experience with patients individually, so they can get a bit overwhelmed by the scope of this course,” said Edmondson. “But by the end of the experience, everyone’s really shifted their focus. They start to understand the power of speaking to many people at the same time and how they can impact their communities.” The other participants in the course – health promotion students – are less intimidated by public outreach due to the scope of their education as public health professionals, she said. But most have not had the chance to implement their own program. In the 2021-22 academic year, 32 students in Edmondson’s course conducted 13 public health education projects across the northern Indiana region, including St. Joseph and Elkhart counties. Among the projects were a three-day program to teach oral health to fourth grade students in the Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph County; a program to teach good sleep habits to high school students at Elkhart High School in Elkhart, Ind.; and a program about positive stress management for members of the South Bend Center for the Homeless, the region’s largest residential facility for individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Although oral hygiene is a natural topic for many of the students in the course, Edmondson said students are encouraged to investigate the needs of the communities to which they’re speaking to tailor topics to their needs. Children from the Boys & Girls Club filled out coloring books to learn about proper tooth brushing and oral care. Photo courtesy Caylee Gee and Yasmin Leal, Indiana University Sleep deprivation is a major concern among today’s high school students, for example, so the IU students who spoke at Elkhart High School focused their educational program on topics such as the effect of blue light from cell phones on sleep, as well as other strategies to get enough rest. Similarly, she said, stress is an understandably common health issue among people experiencing homelessness, so the students who spoke to this group focused their program on healthy coping methods. The program was also presented in partnership with “Wine and Canvas,” a local business that teaches people to paint in a fun and engaging environment, so the information was delivered in a format that provided participants an opportunity to relax. Yasmin Leal, a senior dental hygiene student who co-led the oral hygiene program at the Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph County, said her project primarily focused on encouraging club members to improve their oral health to prevent cavities and gingivitis. The project was delivered through an afterschool program sponsored by the club at Harrison Elementary School in South Bend. Topics included oral health care tips, as well as other strategies to maintain a healthy mouth, such as foods that strengthen teeth, how often to brush and floss, and when it’s recommended to visit a dentist. They also worked to make the information fun and engaging, such as an activity in which children made “mouths” out of marshmallows and construction paper. Edmondson also noted the students made an impact by handing out new toothbrushes after learning some of the children were sharing theirs with siblings at home. A former member of the Boys and Girls Club of St. Joseph County, Leal said she leveraged connections within the organization to arrange the project. Dentures and a model of the human mouth were among the props used by Gee and Leal during their presentation. Photo courtesy Caylee Gee and Yasmin Leal, Indiana University “I am a former club member and knew I could count on them,” she said. “They’re always looking for guest speakers, professionals or programs to expand members’ knowledge and opportunities.” The program also made a measurable impact on the students, said Caylee Gee, a senior dental hygiene student, who co-led the project. To measure their program’s success, every participant in the course distributes pre- and post-tests to the individuals addressed on the first and last day of the outreach programs. Gee said the fourth-grade students from their program had an overall improvement of 42 percentage points, with post-test scores averaging 94 percent. “We realized that spending multiple days with the students had a large impact,” Gee said. “Plus, we could tell they enjoyed the program. They got excited about the activities every day, and they were eager for us to come back and work with them.” Both students said the course inspired a desire to continue engaging in the community. “Planning this program was a challenging but rewarding journey of self-discovery,” said Leal. “Over the course of the two semesters, I developed skills I didn’t know I had. Now that I know that I’m capable of creating and implementing a successful dental health program, it’s a skill I plan to use again.” Media Contact IU Newsroom Kevin Fryling Senior storyteller P: 812-856-2988 E: kfryling@iu.edu Explore media resources Filed under: Discover the Next Community Engagement IU South Bend Student Experience View all tags Plus sign More stories Health and Wellness 8 communities to partner with IU on heat pump adoption, tree canopy health News at IU March 28 Business and Innovation , Health and Wellness , Science and Technology IU LAB receives architectural design approval for transformational bioscience initiative News at IU June 12",

An energy monitoring kit installed and connected to a machine at the Emerging Manufacturing Collaboration Center, located in Indianapolis’ 16 Tech Innovation District.Photo by Vikram Jadhao, Indiana University Faculty in the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering at IU Bloomington and the School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI will develop advanced manufacturing data models and analytics applications that will recommend processes and protocols to manufacturing companies so they can reduce their energy consumption – increasing factory efficiency and enhancing sustainability. “Currently, over 95% of Indiana manufacturers do not have analytics to correlate their energy usage with factory assembly lines, machines, shifts, operator usage patterns and more,” said Raj Acharya, associate vice president for research and AI innovation at IU, the John H. Rudy Professor of Computing, Engineering and Informatics at the Luddy School and principal investigator on the project. “This understanding, coupled with solutions to detected problems, will allow manufacturers to immediately see the improvement in their energy usage processes.” The researchers will also create educational resources, including a raw data repository and new curricula, and work alongside students to provide them with hands-on experience in developing and implementing analytics models to evaluate energy data. A cross-disciplinary collaboration Raj Acharya.Photo by Indiana University The project is a collaboration among Indiana’s top research universities – IU, Purdue University and the University of Notre Dame – along with industry and nonprofit partners Amazon Web Services, Conexus Indiana, Energy Systems Network and the Emerging Manufacturing Collaboration Center, which is located in Indianapolis’ 16 Tech Innovation District. These partners are brought together by two concurrent programs: AnalytiXIN , an initiative facilitated by the Central Indiana Corporate Partnership to develop a digital community, including a place-focused collaboration hub in Indianapolis, that will strengthen connections and encourage engagement of academic data science research and development talent with their industry peers to drive sustained innovation within Indiana. Energy INsights , which helps participating Indiana manufacturers integrate an Amazon Web Services-connected platform, cutting-edge computer and sensor hardware, and AI and data science software tools to optimize energy efficiency at their factories. Researchers at IU, Purdue and Notre Dame will work closely to collect and analyze data gathered from Energy INsights and university testbeds to develop applications and a raw data repository, or a “data lake,” for use by the broader industry, research and education communities. The researchers will package their apps into customizable assets on the Amazon Web Services cloud, where they’ll be available to manufacturers. Leveraging IU expertise Vikram Jadhao.Photo by Indiana University Vikram Jadhao, associate professor of intelligent systems engineering at the Luddy School and co-principal investigator on the project, said the three universities will also work separately to put their own unique spin on the applications they develop, based on the expertise of their faculty. At IU, researchers bring together a variety of interdisciplinary experience, particularly in the Luddy School’s Department of Intelligent Systems Engineering, which was founded in 2016. The department connects faculty experts in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, modeling and simulation, cloud computing, and more. “We are probably the first institution in the world where engineering is viewed through the lens of artificial intelligence and computing,” Jadhao said. The Luddy School is also home to the Fibers and Additive Manufacturing Enabled Systems Laboratory , directed by Alexander Gumennik, an assistant professor of intelligent systems engineering in the school. The state-of-art lab consists of approximately 3,000 square feet of clean rooms, optical laboratories and manufacturing facilities with innovative highly customized equipment. This is where IU researchers plan to test and calibrate their energy analytics applications for the project. “Our university’s role in this one-of-a-kind project speaks to the world-class quality of the informatics, computing and engineering research program that we’ve built at IU,” IU Vice President for Research Fred H. Cate said. “This is a great example of how IU faculty and students are working at the forefront of emerging fields of research to help make Indiana a better place to live and work.” Training the workforce of the future Although much AI research has been applied to health and health care, Acharya said this is one of the first research projects to combine the fields of energy, AI and manufacturing. “No single curriculum currently offers this diverse set of training disciplines, presenting both a challenge and a unique opportunity,” Acharya said. “As part of this effort, we will create a unique training and education curriculum at the intersection of engineering, computer science, AI, machine learning and technology.” In addition to building industry tools, IU will develop extensive education and training materials, including lectures, tutorials, lab environments, training exercises and high-fidelity simulations of energy-saving solutions in practice. The project will also offer extensive hands-on experience and industry internship opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at IU. Luddy School student Anisha Bajaj, who is pursuing a master’s degree in data science, said the project will be a good learning opportunity. “I am very excited about working on the project,” Bajaj said. “We are trying to predict future energy consumption for small-scale industries, and, using the prediction, we will try to recommend actions to save energy. This will help further my career goals by providing a real-world experience of applying my AI and machine-learning knowledge to a tangible problem.” The two-year project is already underway, with IU researchers setting up manufacturing testbeds on campus. Additional IU Bloomington and IUPUI faculty involved in the project include Ariful Azad, Prateek Sharma, Euzeli Cipriano Dos Santos and Travis Brown.

Photo by Chris Meyer, Indiana University Indiana University needs an army of volunteers to successfully operate all the concessions stands at sporting events. Fortunately, eager local nonprofits have provided IU with critical help while receiving needed — and record — funding in return. Nonprofits can earn up to 14% of their sales in commission. Roy Lubovsky, director of athletic dining, said he is forecasting that about $570,000 will be paid to the 25 nonprofits volunteering at football, men’s and women’s basketball, soccer, softball and baseball games this school year. That would be more than double what was paid out last year. The mutually beneficial relationship between the university and community organizations has produced a lot of good will, trust and enjoyment, and it also has provided many teenagers their first work experience. “Everyone recognizes the value of it — not just the funding, but for the youth and what they learn,” said Marni Karaffa, the concessions group leader for Scouts BSA Troops 148 and 1148 based at St. Paul United Methodist Church, which has helped IU for at least 25 years. Scouts and parents from the troops have staffed stands at football and men’s and women’s basketball games this season. The scouts have developed their communication skills by taking orders and working together, Karaffa said, and have learned how to work under pressure and keep track of inventory. “Working the games can be hard work,” she said. “It’s a challenge but a lot of fun.” Last year the troops made about $30,000 in commission, she said, and this year they expect to make at least $32,000. A portion of the funding pays for the troops’ equipment, gas money and propane for camping, and the rest is divided between scouts’ accounts based on how many shifts they’ve worked. They can use the money to cover the costs of special trips, uniforms and equipment, for example. Lubovsky also has tabbed the troops for help with additional events such as Little 500 and graduation, Karaffa said. “We feel very fortunate to have the opportunity,” she said. “They trust us to help and represent IU as well.” IU has invited nonprofit organizations to sell concessions for the past 27 years, Lubovsky said. A group is required to be a 501(c)3 registered nonprofit. Civic organizations, churches, youth sports organizations, Scout troops, parent-teacher organizations and animal rescue groups are among the current volunteering groups.

Photo by Chris Meyer, Indiana University Until three years ago, nonprofits typically had to wait four to six years for an opening to sell concessions because there was little turnover, Lubovsky said. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the aging of some groups, the addition of alcohol sales and the success of the women’s basketball team have necessitated more concessions workers, he added. In fact, the need has been so great that Lubovsky hired Cindy Graham this school year as the nonprofit coordinator for concessions. She oversees recruiting nonprofits, training, scheduling and game-day meetings with nonprofit group leaders. Graham said there will be a great need for concessions help at football and men’s and women’s basketball games next year. IU pays for any alcohol permits needed and provides the training, inventory, uniforms and a free meal at games, Lubovsky said. The volunteers just need to bring a good attitude and their willingness to help. Youths who are at least 14 can work at a concession stand, and Lubovsky said that experience has led to him hiring some of the teens over the years. Nonprofits earn a minimum 10% of sales in commission and can earn 1% bonuses for meeting other standards, such as working both the football and basketball seasons, being on time and having the proper number of volunteers for an entire season. Some groups will make $40,000 to $50,000 this year, Lubovsky said. “What a way to significantly profit for your organization, and it’s good for a lot of groups to bring the kids in to work so they have ownership of what they are raising money for,” Graham said. “It’s great work experience.” Brooke Fleener, Bloomington High School North’s Best Buddies adviser and Unified track and bowling coach, said that working IU concession stands has given students with disabilities valuable work experience, and the funding has helped sustain the groups. “We’re grateful to IU for allowing us to participate,” Fleener said. “It’s not about only the money but also about employability skills and life skills and opportunities for kids who want jobs.” The students’ experiences selling concessions shows local employers that they are dependable and work hard, Fleener added. Bloomington North’s Best Buddies and Unified programs expect to make at least $7,200 working all the men’s basketball games this year, Fleener said. Last year they shared a football concession stand with their counterparts at Bloomington High School South. “We don’t have to worry about money for kids to participate, and they have snacks, T-shirts, uniforms, meals and help with tennis shoes if needed,” Fleener said. Nonprofits that are interested in volunteering to sell concessions at IU Athletics events should contact Graham at cjmorris@iu.edu or 812-327-6486.

      "extracted_content": "Sports Innovation survey reveals Central Indiana sports loyalties Sep 8, 2017 Indiana University men’s basketball was selected as the second-most popular hometown team in a survey of 500 Central Indiana sports fans. The 2017 Indianapolis Colts season is about to get underway, and Central Indiana sports fans will be paying close attention – closer than they do with any other area sports team or entity. According to a study of 500 Central Indiana residents about their perceptions of sports leagues and teams, conducted by the Sports Innovation Institute at IUPUI , the Colts and the NFL are by far the most popular. When asked to choose one favorite hometown team, 221 of 500 respondents picked the Colts, four times as many as chose the second-favorite team, and 159 of the 500 said the NFL was their favorite league. The survey was conducted in mid-July across a wide range of fans over 18 years of age, with an average age of 47. “Every way you can look at the NFL and the Colts, they share the strongest brand image and position in the local market,” said David Pierce, an associate professor in the Indiana University School of Physical Education and Tourism Management at IUPUI, who oversaw the survey for the Sports Innovation Institute. Respondents were asked to rank their overall feelings about sports leagues on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being highest. The NFL scored a 4.47, even higher than “sports in general” at 4.26. The Colts scored a 4.36 among respondents asked for their overall feelings on a scale of 1 to 5 about hometown teams and major events; nothing else scored above 4. Following the Colts were Butler men’s basketball at 3.97, the Indianapolis 500 at 3.95, and then a tie between the Indiana Pacers and the Indianapolis Indians at 3.94. “The Indians’ score is pretty competitive for something that’s at the minor-league level of competition,” Pierce said. “That speaks to the team’s game experience.” The second-favorite league/entity after the NFL among respondents was college basketball, and IU men’s basketball was the second choice for favorite hometown team behind the Colts, with 54 of the 500 respondents choosing the Hoosiers. A question of “hometown fandom” allowed respondents to choose more than one favorite team/major event, and more than half of all respondents – 77.2 percent – named the Colts. They were followed by the Pacers, at 49.8 percent, the Indianapolis 500, at 44.2 percent, IU men’s basketball, at 38 percent, and Butler men’s basketball, at 36.2 percent. Pierce said that future installations of the survey will be intriguing to watch in terms of whether any teams or leagues become more or less popular. The LPGA Tour, for example, is debuting a new tournament this weekend in Indianapolis. The LPGA ranked 21st out of 23 leagues for overall feelings by respondents.

      "extracted_content": "IU Athletics extends helping hand to Florida volleyball team in aftermath of Hurricane Irma Sep 15, 2017 The Florida Gulf Coast University volleyball players found themselves stranded in North Carolina last weekend, unable to return home to Fort Myers as Hurricane Irma headed toward their beach town. The team had just finished a tournament in North Carolina and wasn’t due in Indiana to play in the Hoosier Classic tournament for several days. But as storm surges and heavy winds raked the southwest Florida coast, flooding homes, collapsing buildings and displacing families, Indiana University Athletics searched for a way to help the team during the devastating time. Florida Gulf Coast University’s volleyball team has been using IU Athletics’ practice facility and weight room, hosting study tables and reviewing film since they arrived in Bloomington on Monday. Photo courtesy of IU Athletics IU head volleyball coach Sherry Dunbar-Kruzan picked up the phone and invited the Florida Gulf Coast team to come to Indiana early. “We are happy that Florida Gulf Coast is here and safe. We wanted to do what he could to make them feel comfortable this week,” Dunbar-Kruzan said. “The volleyball community is great, and if we were in this situation, others would step up and help us.” Along with making them feel comfortable, IU wanted to help the players stick to as much of a normal schedule as possible. Since arriving in Bloomington on Monday evening, the team has been using IU Athletics’ practice facility and weight room, hosting study tables and reviewing film. IU is also covering half of the team’s hotel and travel expenses for the extra days they had to be in town. IU football ticket giveaway Florida Gulf Coast head coach Matt Botsford is familiar with Hoosier hospitality. Before he began his tenure at Florida Gulf Coast, he served as an assistant coach at Notre Dame, IUPUI and the University of Indianapolis. During some down time this week, he took the team to Indianapolis to explore the city, have dinner and attempt to take their minds off the destruction they may return home to. “This week has been overwhelming for us,” Botsford said. “We are so thankful to IU, the coaching staff and administration for welcoming us with open arms and all they have done for us.” Both teams and their coaches are excited to play in the Hoosier Classic tournament this weekend, and they encourage the community to come out to watch. “Florida Gulf Coast has a great program, and we hope people will come out and watch some great volleyball this weekend in Bloomington,” Dunbar-Kruzan said. The Hoosier Classic takes place today and Saturday, Sept. 15 and 16, at the University Gym. A full schedule is available on the IU Athletics website.

The annual Day of Caring was Oct. 21, which saw community involvement outside on a beautiful fall day as well as inside some of the city’s nonprofit organizations. Each fall, IUPUI partners with United Way to host Day of Caring, bringing Jaguars in service to the Indianapolis community. Volunteers impact the nonprofits and the community overall by helping to complete projects the organizations may not have the time, staff or money to address. Some Jags trimmed out paper snowflakes at the Indiana State Museum to supply young visitors for the winter season, while others planted trees near Gladstone and 10th streets. The tree planting was a partnership with Keep Indianapolis Beautiful . Other service opportunities included harvesting plants from the urban garden at Growing Places Indy and Fletcher Place Community Center , maintaining trails at White River State Park , and marking storm drains with the City of Indianapolis Department of Public Works. Multiple student organizations took part, such as Honors College Floor 8, National Residence Hall Honorary, Alpha Phi Omega and Pre-Dental Club, in addition to various first-year seminar courses.

Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University When roughly 1,000 kindergartners hop in a bus and head toward a place full of activities planned just for them, there is bound to be excitement. “Today, I’m going to college,” screamed a voice from the McCordsville Elementary bus, which participated in the Hancock County Promise. On Sept. 14, students from 47 classrooms at 12 elementary schools around Hancock County met at Carroll Stadium to participate in the “Walk into Your Future” event. This event gives kindergartners the opportunity to visit a college campus, participate in a field day, learn about college and interact with college student volunteers. The “promise” this event makes to the children is that their community believes in and supports them in their journey toward having a bright future. The Hancock County Promise is sponsored by six organizations around 18 Hancock County communities dedicated to supporting kids in its county to go to college and reach their full potential. When the children sign up, parents are given the opportunity to open a CollegeChoice 529 Direct Savings Account for their kids to start saving for college. The moment a parent signs up their child for an account, the community’s sponsoring organizations automatically contribute $25 to the college fund. Between then and Christmas, if the child raises $25 more, the sponsors will put an additional $25 into the account, totaling a $50 donation from them to the child’s future. A kindergartner from Hancock County swings a tennis racquet during the Sept. 14 Hancock County Promise event. Photo by Liz Kaye, Indiana University Scott Shipley, director of secondary education for Mt. Vernon Community Schools and chairperson for the Hancock County Promise, believes wholeheartedly in the mission of the Promise and said he could not thank IUPUI enough for allowing Hancock County to host the event on campus. Shipley said research shows that if kids have hope and belief that college is a place for them, they are more likely to attend. If they have a college savings account, they are three times more likely to go to college, even if they have less than $500 in the account. Finally, if they believe they can succeed in college, children are four times more likely to graduate from postsecondary school. Jennifer Zotz, senior program coordinator for Campus Visits and Events, and Jessica Klage, associate director of Campus Visits and Events, agree with Shipley’s confidence in the program’s goals and thoughts of how important this is for the children and the community. “Even though this event is huge for our campus, it’s only a piece of a puzzle that makes a larger picture,” Zotz said. “In the classrooms, kids do coursework around what a person needs to do to go to college, and schools work with parents on trying to educate them on how they can save for their kids’ college. Through all this, we’re telling a whole community we value education on every level, not just seniors in high school.” “Educating students at a young age about college being even a possibility is so important,” Klage said. “For some kids, this might be the only time they set foot on a college campus. Also, the partnership with Hancock County and the children is important for our community’s growth.” Not only do the staff of the Hancock County Promise and IUPUI think it is important, but student volunteers and organizations from IUPUI also see the benefits of this program. Jagathon volunteer Jordyn Boecker said it is important to let kids know they are welcome and at home in college. This might encourage them to enroll later in life, said the sophomore, who is studying psychology. IUPUI men’s soccer player Gianni Catenacci said that wanting to be a role model is only part of the reason he volunteered. “Having the kids see how much fun we are having while at college might plant a seed in the kids’ heads about wanting to go someday,” the sophomore biology major said. “That’s half the fun right there.” Author IU Newsroom Ashlynn Neumeyer Explore media resources Filed under: Athletics Events Inside IUPUI View all tags Plus sign More stories Business and Innovation New co-op opens doors for Tourism, Event and Sport Management students in hotel industry News at IU April 14 Health and Wellness , Science and Technology IU, Cook Medical partnership will translate IU research into real-world applications News at IU September 2",

Dr. Thomas W. McAllister.Photo courtesy of the IU School of Medicine The NCAA-DOD Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium , known as the CARE Consortium, was established as part of the broader NCAA-DOD Grand Alliance in 2014, with the goals of understanding how concussions affect the brain and identifying ways to improve diagnosis, treatment and prevention. Led by Indiana University School of Medicine, the University of Michigan and the Medical College of Wisconsin, in collaboration with the Uniformed Services University, the study has collected data on more than 39,000 student-athletes and cadets at 30 colleges and military service academies – including more than 3,300 who have experienced concussions. This represents the largest sample of concussions ever researched in a single study. Media kit: Access additional images, video and materials The initial phase of the study – made possible by a joint NCAA-Department of Defense grant of $30 million – focused on the acute effects of concussions by evaluating concussed participants with a sequence of clinical and advanced research tests in the immediate hours, days and weeks after the injury, and comparing the results with baseline tests administered at the start of the study. The new phase will include comprehensive testing of the participants when they leave college and up to four years after their collegiate sports or service academy career has ended. This expanded approach will enable researchers to study the intermediate and cumulative effects of concussion and repetitive head impact exposure. Importantly, researchers hope to differentiate between the effects of concussion, repetitive head impact, and sports participation with no history of either concussion or repetitive head impact exposure. “We have gathered important information about the short-term effects of concussions over the past few years, but there is still a lot we do not understand about how our brains respond to different types of impact over time,” said Dr. Thomas W. McAllister , chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Indiana University School of Medicine and the leader of the study’s administrative and operations center. “By comparing these groups across multiple years, we think we can parse out the effects of concussions, versus repetitive head impacts, versus normal life at university. This is critical for us to make informed decisions that protect our athletes, members of the military and other members of our communities.” The evaluations will include clinical tests to assess attributes such as balance and memory but also will probe changes to participants’ psychological health to determine what role, if any, concussions and repetitive head impacts may have on depression, anxiety and emotional control. Researchers also will continue to conduct advanced research tests, including genetic analysis, brain imaging and blood tests to measure biomarkers associated with inflammation and nervous system dysfunction. It is conceivable that the advanced research tests will help identify genes and other objective markers that render an athlete or cadet more or less susceptible to concussion or injury from repetitive head impacts. The NCAA is providing $12.5 million in funding over two years for the second stage of research. The Department of Defense approved a two-year grant of nearly $10 million. IU Bloomington is among the institutions with athletes participating in the study. Video: Learn about IU Bloomington’s participation in the study “This new phase of funding represents a critical extension to the original study goals, allowing us to take an unprecedented look at cumulative and persistent effects of concussion and repetitive head impact exposure,” said Dr. Brian Hainline, NCAA chief medical officer. “What we learn from this research will advance the science of traumatic brain injury and improve our understanding of how to best support the health and well-being of student-athletes, not only during their collegiate athletics experience but beyond.” In addition to expanding the scope of the study, the CARE Consortium is adding a representative from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences to its research team. Dr. Paul F. Pasquina is a retired Army colonel, professor and chair of the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine and director of the Center for Rehabilitation Sciences Research. His role with the CARE Consortium is to promote and facilitate the involvement of the four military service academies in the consortium. “Optimizing the health and performance of our warfighters is paramount to enhancing the readiness and lethality of the force,” Terry M. Rauch, acting deputy assistant secretary of defense (Health Readiness Policy and Oversight), said regarding the Department of Defense’s participation in the study. “Traumatic brain injuries are a major readiness concern as our warfighters are particularly susceptible to these injuries during combat and training. The department is leading efforts in research to better understand how to prevent, diagnose and treat TBIs across the range of military operations. However, much more work needs to be done, and this partnership with the NCAA and participating academic institutions provides valuable evidence to optimize the health and performance of our warfighters.” Other study leaders include: Steven Broglio, professor of kinesiology and director of the Michigan Concussion Center at the University of Michigan. Broglio leads the longitudinal clinical study core, which oversees all clinical aspects of the study. Michael McCrea, professor of neurosurgery and co-director of the Center for Neurotrauma Research at the Medical College of Wisconsin. McCrea leads the advanced research core, which includes head impact sensor technologies, advanced neuroimaging and biological markers that include detailed genetic testing. Indiana University School of Medicine, under the direction of McAllister, which provides regulatory and fiduciary oversight, as well as biostatistics and data management, neuroimaging, bioinformatics, biomarkers/biospecimen management, and other support resources for the consortium. Indiana University School of Medicine partners with the Datalys Center and QuesGen Systems in this effort. Already, the CARE Consortium has generated information related to important topics such as the impact of removing student-athletes from play after a concussion; the influence of age at the time of first concussion; sleep and concussion recovery; and tools and tests used to assess concussions. A list of the scientific publications resulting from the CARE Consortium study may be found on the NCAA Sport Science Institute website.

That’s the conclusion of a study, co-authored by an Indiana University geologist, which finds that salmon can play a significant role in shaping mountain landscapes. A pair of sockeye salmon spawn in Alaska.Photo by Katrina Mueller, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Brian Yanites, an assistant professor in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences, and his co-authors model the effect of spawning salmon on riverbed erosion and calculate how it affects mountain landscapes. Their paper, “Sex that moves mountains: The influence of spawning fish on river profiles over geologic timescales,” is being published by the journal Geomorphology. The authors examine how spawning salmon stir up sediment in riverbeds and accelerate the erosion of river channels. They combine that information with mathematical formulations of sediment transport and erosion to show how the presence of salmon reshapes mountains and valleys. “While the influence of salmon reproduction on sediment transport has been known, this is the first paper that has suggested the process could influence the height and shape of the landscape over long timescales and large spatial scales, such as the extent of a mountain range,” Yanites said. One surprising finding was that salmon could influence erosion significantly. For example, the authors calculated that a landscape where salmon spawn could be up to 30 percent lower than a comparable landscape with no salmon present. Salmon hatch in fresh water, live their lives in oceans, then return to rivers and streams to spawn. Female salmon turn on their sides and flap their tails to build nests, called redds, in which they lay eggs. Males then fertilize the eggs, which develop and hatch. In building the nests, the female salmon stir up sediment and help expose the riverbed, leading to more erosion nearby and downstream. Brian Yanites Some salmon are more potent mountain-movers than others, according to the study. Different species prefer to build their redds in different types of sediment, from the coarse grains found in the upper reaches of streams to the finer grains found downstream. Chinook salmon will spawn in a wider range of grain sizes than sockeye and pink salmon, the other two species studied; therefore, chinook salmon can disrupt longer reaches of rivers and streams and have a greater impact on erosion. The study suggests salmon are at the center of a cycle of the building up and wearing down of mountains. Mountains are built by tectonic processes that lift rocks to higher elevations. In the Pacific Northwest, scientists believe, mountain-building created distinct environments that led to species “radiation” – the evolution of distinct salmon species from a common ancestor. Those salmon species, through their spawning, contribute to erosion that wears down the very mountains that allowed the species to develop in the first place. “More species means a wider range of grain size in which spawning can occur and therefore a greater impact on erosion,” Yanites said. “Thus we suggest that the radiation of salmon species in the Pacific Northwest may have lowered the elevation of mountains in the region.” Alexander Fremier, an associate professor in the School of the Environment at Washington State University, is the lead author of the paper. Elowyn Yager, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Idaho, is a co-author.

      "extracted_content": "Indiana University research shows increasing minimum wage would reduce teen pregnancies For Immediate Release Mar 8, 2017 Lindsey Bullinger BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – A $1 increase in the minimum wage would likely reduce the U.S. adolescent birth rate by about 2 percent, according to new Indiana University research. That would mean about 5,000 fewer births annually, and the number could go higher if the minimum wage increase climbed over $1, according to Lindsey Rose Bullinger, the study author and an associate instructor and doctoral student at the IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs . “Higher wages can give teens a reason to keep working,” Bullinger said. “Their advancement opportunities would improve, and they’d have good reason to delay childbearing or substitute work for leisure.” Many studies have looked at the impact of a minimum wage hike on the economy, but few have analyzed the public health implications. It is a critical issue because the U.S. has the highest adolescent birth rate among developed countries. Infants of teen mothers generally have worse birth outcomes than children of older mothers. Additionally, parenthood at an early age costs the public more than $9 billion annually because of expenses related to health care, foster care and foregone tax revenue from parents who leave the labor force. “We know from previous research that an increase in the minimum wage is good for the health of the worker,” Bullinger said. “They live longer, have lower body mass indexes and are less likely to abuse children, among other benefits. This study adds to those findings by showing that higher pay means fewer births to adolescent parents. This is especially true for non-Hispanic white and Hispanic adolescents because they are more likely to be affected by minimum wage increases.” The federal minimum wage is $7.25, but some cities and states have higher rates, including San Francisco and Seattle, where $15 is the hourly minimum. So increases of more than $1 are not unrealistic, which could avert even more teen births. Bullinger conducted a sophisticated statistical analysis of the differences in birth rates from state to state. Bullinger’s complete findings were published in the peer-reviewed article “The Effect of Minimum Wages on Adolescent Fertility: A Nationwide Analysis,” published in the American Journal of Public Health.

      "extracted_content": "NSF-funded IUPUI study of non-rainfall water in Namib Desert reveals unexpected origins For Immediate Release Mar 22, 2017 Lixin Wang kneels in Namib Desert to check computer as Kudzai Farai Kaseke, a graduate student, observes. INDIANAPOLIS – In a study conducted in one of the world’s oldest and most biologically diverse deserts, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis scientists explored the origins of water other than rainfall and are identifying multiple origins. The study, supported by the National Science Foundation, is the first to report that the ocean is not the sole source of life-sustaining fog and dew for numerous plants and animals living in the Namib Desert. Understanding the sources of water is essential for developing ecological models of arid environments and is key to understanding how plants and animals sustain themselves and function under current or future climates. Fog and – to a lesser degree – dew are crucial sources of moisture in this desert environment. “Knowing exactly where the fog and dew come from will help us predict the availability of non-rainfall water in the future, both in the Namib and elsewhere,” said Lixin Wang, an ecohydrologist and assistant professor of earth sciences in the School of Science at IUPUI, who led the new study. “With this knowledge, we may be able to determine ways to harvest novel water sources for potential use in water-scarcity situations.” Surprisingly, non-ocean-derived fog accounted for more than half of the total fog events in the Namib over the one-year period of the IUPUI study. Groundwater-derived fog was the most significant locally generated fog, serving as a source of more than a quarter of the desert’s fog. Soil water, which derives from rainfall and is below the surface but located higher than groundwater, was also found by the researchers to be an unexpected source of moisture. Drylands, which in addition to deserts include parched but nondesert areas of the Great Plains and southwestern United States, cover approximately 40 percent of Earth’s land surface and are home to an estimated 2.5 billion people. With global warming, more areas in the United States and around the world are becoming drier and more desert-like. “Dryland ecosystems have some of the lowest annual rainfall amounts recorded on Earth,” said Tom Torgersen, program officer in the National Science Foundation’s Division of Earth Sciences. “To survive, these ecosystems recycle water in the form of fog and dew. In the driest places on the planet, even seemingly minor components of the water cycle, such as fog and dew, become major and are critical to keeping the environment alive and functioning.” Like other dryland ecosystems worldwide, the Namib is likely to experience changes in its hydrological cycle in response to global climate change. Given the abundance and importance of fog and dew in this desert, it provides an ideal location to study non-rainfall water. The Namib, which borders the Atlantic Ocean for 1,243 miles with temperatures ranging from below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), is almost completely devoid of surface water. Many parts of the Namib receive virtually no rain. Some years are rainless; in other years, there may be only an inch or two of rain, although some areas may receive as many as four inches. But the Namib does support a wide variety of specially adapted organisms, such as a fog-harvesting beetle. Most of the Namib’s plants and animals are believed to obtain moisture from fog or dew during rainless periods to be able to survive. Fog consists of tiny droplets of water suspended in air, and dew consists of tiny droplets that form on the surface of plants, soil and other objects on the ground. Wang’s research focuses on the intersection of hydrology, ecology and isotope geochemistry. He used analysis of stable isotopes in water – the same element with different neutron numbers in the nuclei such as of hydrogen and oxygen – to trace the origins of non-rainfall water. In future research, he plans to explore the mechanisms by which groundwater and soil water become fog and dew. The long-term goal is to expand this ecohydrology research beyond the Namib to a global scale. “Non-rainfall Water Origins and Formation Mechanisms” is published online in Science Advances, a publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Study authors, along with Wang, are Kudzai Farai Kaseke and Mary K. Seely. Kaseke is an IUPUI doctoral student in Wang’s group who accompanied Wang on the field research for the study and is the first author of this publication. Seely is a desert ecologist and the former director of the Gobabeb Research and Training Center in Namibia who has studied the Namib for more than half a century.

It shows an older adult man seated in a chair. He’s wearing headphones, but there is no sound. His eyes are closed. He might even be asleep. Jennie Gubner.Photo by James Brosher, IU Communications Then, his hand twitches, and his eyes open. He starts singing. All around the classroom, Gubner’s students are smiling. The power of music In less than a minute, the power of music is illustrated in a video featuring an individual with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease at a local health care facility in Bloomington. Gubner’s service-learning course is a mix of neuroscience, ethnomusicology, film workshop, health care studies and so much more. “It’s an interdisciplinary, hands-on course,” she said. “We explore the relationship between music, memory and the brain through fieldwork, filmmaking and service work in the local Bloomington community.” Gubner is a visiting lecturer in the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology and taught Music and Memory for the first time at IU Bloomington this spring. Throughout the course, her 18 students visit with about 18 local residents who are in nursing homes or involved in senior adult programs – the majority of whom have been diagnosed with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. The students work in pairs and meet with the older adult, their family and the facility’s staff to make a personalized music playlist that can be kept on an iPod after the class has finished. They also record their interactions with the senior citizens on video and keep a hand-written log of their weekly visits. Their films show older adults swaying from side-to-side, singing along to Frank Sinatra’s “The Way You Look Tonight” and dancing to Johnny Cash’s “Ring of Fire.” While listening to a familiar tune may seem like a simple way to pass the time, it’s doing much more than that for the senior citizens the students are interacting with. “We’re not just doing it for fun, because it’s a nice idea or because we need to fill people’s time,” said Cathleen Weber, owner and executive director of the Better Day Club, an adult day program in Bloomington partnering with Gubner’s class. “This becomes something really useful and adaptable to them for the remainder of their disease process.” The students create a personalized music history for the people they are interacting with. Listening to the music brings the senior citizens joy, but it can also be calming and bring them back to themselves, she said. “Music works in a different part of our brains than our language center, and as a result, it is accessible to us long after our expressive abilities and language erodes through the process of dementia,” Weber said. “Music does not replace all medication, but it can certainly alleviate some of the symptoms and the challenges that we traditionally use medicine for.” Once the playlists are done, Gubner and her students spend time talking with residents, caregivers, family and staff to advocate the use of these playlists as a targeted approach to combatting anxiety, depression, memory loss, and other symptoms associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s like sundowning, a syndrome of Alzheimer’s when people tend to feel much worse around dusk and can become agitated. This shift, from understanding music solely as a form of entertainment, to embracing its ability to actively promote health and wellness, is at the heart of the culture change Gubner is working to promote. Photos by James Brosher, IU Communications At the start of the class, students supplied the older adult and their families with a questionnaire that asked about preferred styles of music, favorite artists or genres and, most importantly, if there are particular songs or artists associated with moments in their lives. As the older adult listens to a certain tune or artist, they return to the moment when they danced at their wedding, when they turned on the radio during their first date or when they attended their first concert live. Reality is a roller coaster Back in Gubner’s classroom, sophomore Nathan Siddell talked about the film he just shared of the 101-year-old who seemingly woke up and began singing. “He’s usually very taciturn, reserved,” Siddell said. “It was fun to actually get something out of him when he was listening to the music.” The field work Gubner’s students are doing isn’t always fun, however. While they often see breakthroughs with the people they’re working with and are excited to interact with them each week, they are also faced with the reality of the populations they work with. Maggie Kennedy, a freshman studying neuroscience, shared a video clip of her interview with a husband who spoke candidly about his wife’s experience with Alzheimer’s, and the reasons he decided to sign her up for the Music and Memory program. “The idea is to have joy and to have pleasure, because frankly, if you are in her position where you can only look forward to losing one faculty after another, there really is no purpose in living,” he said. “The disease is like a roller coaster,” Kennedy said when she explained why she chose to share the clip with her classmates. “It was very real, and I think it was very important.” For freshman Emily Mangione, it was her firsthand experience with Alzheimer’s that made her want to join the class. “My grandma has Alzheimer’s and has been in a nursing home,” she said. “She was in a band; my family is musical. At family parties, I can see how music affects her. It changes her mood.” Mangione, a pre-nursing major, plans to go home and use what she’s learned in Gubner’s class to help her grandmother and to try to get the Music and Memory Program implemented at her nursing home. Expanding Music and Memory Gubner’s course is based on the Music and Memory Program offered by a nonprofit organization developed by social worker Dan Cohen. Through her service-learning course, Gubner has helped to get two facilities in Bloomington certified in the program. “There were no facilities in the Bloomington area certified when I was offered this job last spring,” Gubner said. ”After months of phone calls and meetings explaining the benefits of the program, I was delighted to find immediate support from Cathleen Weber at the Better Day Club and Meghan Yoder at Gentry Park Senior Living.” The certification for a large facility is $1,000 and includes training the facility’s staff, ongoing online support and resources, and the cost of some iPods. For many facilities, the cost is too much. Gubner’s students have become so passionate about their work in the class that they’ve started a Music and Memory Club at IU. They have also created their own GoFundMe site with a goal of raising $2,500 by the end of the semester to certify two more Bloomington facilities in the program. The motivation of Gubner’s students to raise awareness is a reflection of the excitement they feel during the class as they develop relationships with the individuals they are working with. “The work they are doing and the films they are producing are phenomenal,” Gubner said. “They are very emotional coming out of the field. They want to share these experiences and stories with others, and film gives them the opportunity to do so.” “I think the students have been joyfully and happily surprised at how much these older adults have to offer,” Weber said. “They have so much richness to share. A number of people who attend the club are retired professors from the university or retired teachers in the community. It has helped to reposition them in that role. They are teaching the students about different aspects of their lives and talking about history through their music.” Gubner will teach the Music and Memory course in the fall.

The IU Food Institute has over 1,000 books and resources in its new library.Photo by Bailey Briscoe, IU Communications The IU Food Institute incorporates the IU Food Project and is an initiative by the College of Arts and Sciences to support and expand upon the food-related research and courses on the Bloomington campus. One of its main goals is to find innovative ways to address what we eat and how we eat, with an environmental focus. The institute found its home on campus at 405/407 N. Park St. in the fall. And inside its new building is a research library full of volumes on food history, culture, cultivation and cooking, now open to the IU community. “The IUFI is already a place where people interested in food from across the university can meet, plan and host events,” said Leigh Bush, a graduate fellow at the IU Food Institute and a Ph.D. candidate in IU’s food studies program. “The library adds to this creative community by also being a place where everyone can come to find resources relating to food that would otherwise be difficult to track down or aren’t available in one space. This is about creating a welcome space for knowledge exchange that is yet to exist for food-interested scholars across disciplines.” The collection includes over 1,000 books and resources, featuring titles such as, “Against the Grain: How Agriculture Has Hijacked Civilization” and “Cheese: A Connoisseur’s Guide to the World’s Best.” Many of the books were donated to the library, and the collections bear the names of their donors, such as Sidney Mintz, one of the founders of contemporary food anthropology, and Christine Barbour, a local food lover and senior lecturer at IU. Several of the books are rare, and a few of them are even signed by the authors. The IU Food Institute library offers space to relax and read.Photo by Bailey Briscoe, IU Communications “We’re excited and fortunate to have this amazing collection of books, many of which have been donated by top food studies scholars around the country,” said Madeline Chera, an IU Food Institute graduate fellow and cultural anthropology Ph.D. student. “We’re happy to be able to collect research and reference materials under one roof where we can bring scholars from across the disciplines together to form new connections and collaborations.” And the library’s collection continues to expand. After her visit to campus , famous chef and food activist Alice Waters offered up parts of her collection for donation to the library. All of the resources are available for use on-site at the IU Food Institute Library, and the goal is to become a lending library for faculty, staff and students in the future. With the summer quickly approaching, the IU Food Institute will have reduced hours. However, the library and other resources will be available by appointment. ‘Earth Eats’ “Earth Eats” by Annie Corrigan is a new IU Press book.Photo courtesy of IU Press Stop by the IU Food Institute at 5 p.m. April 13 to check out the library and hear Annie Corrigan, the host of WFIU’s “Earth Eats” radio show , give a talk on food journalism and translating food scholarship for popular media consumption . “Earth Eats” is a weekly podcast, public radio program and blog that covers food news and recipes inspired by the eat-local movement.

It potentially saved millions of dollars in hospitalization costs. Eskenazi Health campus.Photo courtesy of Eskenazi Health A new paper co-authored by Lisa Harris, CEO of Eskenazi Health, Paul Halverson , founding dean of the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at IUPUI , and Joshua Vest , lead author of the paper and an associate professor of health policy and management at the Fairbanks School of Public Health, finds that the wraparound services, co-located within the primary care setting of the large urban safety-net health provider, were associated with a reduction in the number of hospitalizations and emergency room visits. “Providing nonmedical wraparound services in conjunction with primary care is one strategy to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall health care spending,” Vest said. Joshua Vest Researchers estimated that wraparound services potentially saved $8.2 million from 2011 to 2016, based on median hospitalization costs. The estimate represents an average of $1.4 to $2.4 million potential cost savings per year. Researchers calculated the potential savings by estimating the number of hospitalizations that could have been expected among those receiving wraparound services had the services not been offered. “Early intervention and effective chronic disease management are vital to keeping people out of the hospital and reducing the burden of illness on the patient and on the health care system,” said Dr. Lisa Harris, CEO of Eskenazi Health. “We know, based on our research, that our best opportunity to improve the lives of our patients and, by extension, the health and vitality of our community lies in helping individuals stay well.” Lisa Harris.Photo courtesy of Eskenazi Health In 2011, Eskenazi Health began employing various providers of wraparound services including behavioral health, social work, dietetics, respiratory therapy for asthma education, patient navigation, pharmacist education, financial counseling and a medical-legal partnership. Wraparound services were also associated with a 5 percent reduction in the number of emergency department visits in the year after the services were provided. Researchers did not estimate potential cost savings for emergency department visits because emergency department costs were not available. “Given that health and health care use are largely driven by social situations, environmental context and individual behavior, we believe that addressing these issues holds great promise for reducing costs and improving health outcomes,” Halverson said. Paul Halverson “Historically, the health care system has not addressed these drivers of health and health care costs,” Halverson said. All patients in the study received at least one wraparound service. Counseling from a dietitian was the most common wraparound service, at 49 percent, followed by consultation with a social worker at 29 percent and behavioral health at 10 percent. Given that wraparound services were co-located with primary care, caution must be taken in generalizing the study’s findings to settings that rely on referrals to outside social service providers, the researchers said. The paper, “Indianapolis Provider’s Use of Wraparound Services Associated with Reduced Hospitalizations and Emergency Department Visits,” was published in the journal Health Affairs. Additional authors are Dawn Haut, CEO of Eskenazi Health Center and an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine; and Nir Menachemi, professor of health policy and management and chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Fairbanks School of Public Health.

The results of the study, published in the journal Science Advances , were presented today during a press conference at the 2019 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C. “In a universitywide sample, we found that all students – and black, Latino and Native American students in particular – earn significantly higher grades in STEM courses when their professors believe intelligence is a malleable quality that can be developed over time, compared to when their professors believe intelligence is a fixed trait that cannot change very much,” said first author Elizabeth Canning , a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Mary Murphy , a professor in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who is the study’s principal investigator. An infographic on fixed versus growth mindsets. An accessible version of this graphic is available online.Graphic by Samantha Thompson, Indiana University Moreover, the researchers found that all students did better on average in classes taught by faculty who endorsed more of a growth mindset.Black, Latino and Native American students earned 0.19 fewer GPA points in fixed-mindset classrooms compared to white or Asian students. This gap shrank nearly in half – to 0.10 fewer GPA points – in growth-mindset classrooms. “Students in growth-mindset classrooms reported being ‘motivated to do their best work’ and felt their instructor really cared about their learning and development in classes,” Canning said. Elizabeth Canning.Photo courtesy of Elizabeth Canning, Indiana University Classroom practices and behaviors that convey a fixed or a growth mindset have been identified by Murphy and colleagues’ previous research. Faculty who endorse fixed-mindset beliefs tend to prize flawless performance, for example, while faculty who endorse growth-mindset beliefs tend to value and praise the process of learning, and use mistakes as learning opportunities. To conduct the study, the researchers collected data on 150 faculty and 15,000 students over two years at a large public research university. The study also found that faculty mindset beliefs predicted the racial achievement gaps in their classes more than any other variable, including the faculty member’s gender, race, age, tenure status or teaching experience. “Younger and older faculty – as well as male and female professors from any racial-ethnic background – were equally likely to endorsed fixed ideas about intelligence,” Murphy said. Mary Murphy.Photo by Nickki Ritcher Photography Murphy’s lab is working in collaboration with the IU Center for Innovative Teaching and Learning to create educational modules for first-time university instructors that review the influence of faculty mindset beliefs on student outcomes and provide evidence-based practices that convey growth-mindset beliefs to students in the classroom. She and collaborators have also developed an institute in the Seattle area that trains K-6 teachers to create growth-mindset cultures in their classrooms. “The overall message here is quite optimistic,” Murphy said. “It’s clear that helping faculty understand how to employ growth-mindset practices in their teaching could help thousands of students. After all, faculty set the culture of their classroom; they are the culture creators. This work shows professors have the power to shape students’ motivation, engagement and performance through the mindset culture they create. We need to educate faculty about how their beliefs shape students’ motivation and performance and give them tools to support students in the classroom.” Other authors on the paper are Dorainne Green, a postdoctoral researcher at IU, and Katherine Muenks , a postdoctoral researcher at IU at the time of the study.

IU Herbarium director Eric Knox, left, and a student work with a preserved plant specimen.Photo by Emily Sterneman, Indiana University The project, launched in 2014, provides online access to the complete collection of the IU Herbarium . This information is valuable to the global plant research community, as well as backyard gardeners and nature enthusiasts who wish to learn more about the plants in their environment. “This 21st-century digital herbarium is a gift to the people of Indiana,” said Eric Knox, director of the IU Herbarium and a senior scientist in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences’ Department of Biology. “The botanical information system fundamentally transforms how people identify plants and how researchers conduct science. Hoosiers no longer need an elaborate vocabulary of Greek and Latin technical terms to identify their state’s native and naturalized flora.” The IU Herbarium was founded in 1885, and its largest single collection is the preserved plant samples of Charles and Stella Deam, the first state forester of Indiana and his wife, who published “Flora of Indiana” in 1940. Many of the other specimens, whose origins span 85 countries, joined the collection over decades through the efforts of IU researchers. “The digitization of the IU Herbarium is the culmination of five years of continuous effort to transform the university’s priceless collection of flora – entrusted to IU by generations of scientists – into a resource accessible to experts across the world,” IU President Michael A. McRobbie said. “The project’s completion also represents a major success within the larger framework of IU’s digitization and preservation activities under the IU Bicentennial and exports a small part of our state’s spectacular natural beauty to the global community.” Each record in the IU Digital Herbarium includes a high-resolution photo of the preserved plant specimen, its scientific name and taxonomic placement, its collection location, and the name of the person who collected it. Many entries also contain links to the plant’s genomic data. The collection is divided into five major plant categories: algae, bryophytes (mosses), fungi, lichens and vascular plants. The IU Digital Herbarium also includes common plant names, which opens the collection to the general public. Users can search plants in certain regions based upon physical characteristics to help identify plants on a nature walk or distinguish native plants from invasive species. A preserved plant specimen is prepared for digitization.Photo by Emily Sterneman, Indiana University For example, Bloomington residents can search plants within the Monroe County Checklist . Public checklists were also created for other state counties and ecoregions, as well as parks such as Indiana Dunes National Park, Fort Harrison State Park and Mounds State Park. IU is working with the Indiana Department of Nature Resources and NICHES Land Trust to create lists for other conservation areas in Indiana, and any user can also create a checklist. The database also contains high-resolution images of live plants for most Indiana species, some of which were collected by members of the IU Herbarium. The data is cross-referenced against the text of “Flora of Indiana” and Gleason and Cronquist’s “Manual of Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada” – a major text in the world of botany – to provide greater historical detail about the plants and improve searchability. “The inclusion of common names and familiar images in the database, which helps make this information broadly accessible, is possible in part by the university’s sustained, multiyear commitment to digitizing this collection,” Knox said. Because the IU Herbarium’s data is housed within a larger network of 37 million specimen records from 766 natural history collections across the U.S., IU’s improvements to the collection also benefit many other institutions in the system, including the over 130 other herbaria across the Midwest . Moreover, the IU Herbarium collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to improve the accuracy of the geocoordinates that indicate the collection point of each plant in the system. The resulting system, which overlays historical data with current Google maps, is available to the public at GEOLocate . The IU Herbarium also partnered with the IU Libraries and University Information and Technology Services to ensure access to the many terabytes required to store images in the collection. The Imago system is also available to other Indiana herbaria. It is supported by Jetstream cloud technology operated by IU Research Technologies, part of the Pervasive Technology Institute at IU. “A significant amount of data on Indiana’s flora is now available to the larger research community, and the task of identifying plants in any of Indiana’s 92 counties has been vastly simplified,” Knox said. “These new online tools will enable everyone, from scientists to nonexperts, to gain a greater knowledge and appreciation of our natural world.” Additional support for the IU Digital Herbarium was provided by the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences, the IU Bloomington Department of Biology, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research, the Office of the Vice President for Research, UITS and private donations to the IU Herbarium Fund. What they are saying Heather Calloway, IU executive director of university collections: “The herbarium at Indiana University is one of our most valuable and useful resources. The plant specimens in the collection are literally priceless, as some don’t exist anymore and can be used for DNA testing, and they can also teach us about climate change, conservation and habitat loss. Eric Knox and his team have spent five years working tirelessly to bring this gift to the people of Indiana for research and education, and I expect some of our other collections to pursue similar projects in the coming years.” Craig Stewart, executive director of the Pervasive Technology Institute: “Making available these irreplaceable images and data about the vast array of plants in the IU Herbarium – including the plants collected by Charles Deam – is of great value to the people of Indiana and one of the reasons we supported hosting data from the Herbarium on the Jetstream cloud system.” Media Contact IU Newsroom Kevin Fryling Senior storyteller P: 812-856-2988 E: kfryling@iu.edu Explore media resources Filed under: Bicentennial Priority: Catalyzing Research Bicentennial Priority: Towards a Culture of Building and Making College of Arts and Sciences Community Engagement Libraries News Release Research View all tags Plus sign More stories Global IU Bloomington continues top placement in critical-language scholarship program News at IU June 5 Campus Life Indiana youths explore careers, build confidence at Kids College summer program News at IU July 3",

      "extracted_content": "Researchers create public portal to increase understanding of COVID-19 executive orders’ impact Apr 30, 2020 INDIANAPOLIS – Researchers in the Paul H. O’Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at IUPUI are taking a closer look at executive orders issued in all 50 states meant to manage COVID-19. Their research will eventually allow citizens, as well as those in power, to better understand which orders worked and which did not. Assistant professors Peter Federman and Cali Curley are examining the two types of executive orders issued – restrictions and suspensions – and comparing each state’s actions to its total number of COVID-19 cases. Restrictions include limiting gatherings, closing nonessential businesses and visitation rules. Suspensions aim to relieve pressure on citizens, business and government – such as postponing elections or extending tax deadlines. Peter Federman By using information to track people’s visits to retail and recreation sites, the research team can see how people’s movements aligned with the executive orders and the rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in each state. Data is still being processed, but initial results from four states, including Indiana, reveal interesting differences in how states are managing their COVID-19 responses. When comparing Indiana to Montana, Florida and Ohio, it might appear that Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb issued fewer orders, but each order tended to include more substance. “This is indicative of a centralized approach,” Federman said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean Indiana has done less; it could mean that one single order includes multiple suspensions or restrictions rather than having separate orders for each one.” Similar to the other three states, Indiana’s drop in mobility appears to have occurred just prior to the stay-at-home order. While the order might be working to keep people socially distanced, it appears many had already made the decision to follow CDC guidance. Cali Curley Curley and Federman are creating a public portal to display their findings to help leaders better understand the impact of their decisions for the future and to help individuals hold their governments accountable. “Some of these suspensions have an impact on the public without the public noticing, unless they are paying close attention,” Curley said. “These aspects of the COVID-19 response may have longer-lasting impacts on transparency and accountability in local and state governance.” As states begin to reopen, the team’s data will provide insight into what restrictions were rolled back and how governance changed during and after the pandemic. It also will look at whether more restrictive measures – such as fines or jail time for mandate violations – led to increased social distancing.

From left: Carmel police officers James Semester and James Grose with IUPUI’s Mayur Srivastava, Bhavani Prasad Rao Ejanthkar, Swarnamouli Majumdar, Lou Lenzi and Aamir Khan. Team member I Ting “Tiffany” Tseng is not pictured.Photo courtesy of Swarnamouli Majumdar Along with funds previously awarded, NIST has granted the team a total of $112,500 under the Tech to Protect Challenge , a competition sponsored by the institute’s Public Safety Communications Research Division that provides entrepreneurs, programmers, students and others the opportunity to create solutions to public safety communications challenges faced by fire, law enforcement and emergency medical service responders. The support recognizes the team’s development of Zenext, a voice-command virtual assistant based on Google Assistant that helps law enforcement conduct critical tasks hands-free. The technology works similarly to Siri or Alexa. “This work contributes to the growing need for crisis-response technology,” said Sonny Kirkley , an adjunct assistant professor in the School of Informatics and Computing and an affiliate of the IU Crisis Technologies Innovation Lab , who is one of the team’s mentors. “As technologies like artificial intelligence and voice automation mature, it’s important to tailor their capabilities to specific tasks and professions,” Kirkley said. “Zenext uses voice technology to bridge the gap between police officers and dispatchers and provides connectivity to important emergency agencies like fire departments and EMS.” Members of the IUPUI team are: Bhavani Prasad Rao Ejanthkar , a 2019 master’s degree graduate in computer science from the School of Science. Ejanthkar was responsible for application development on the project. Aamir Khan , a 2020 master’s degree graduate in human-computer interaction from the School of Informatics and Computing. Khan contributed software-engineering expertise to the project. Swarnamouli Majumdar , a 2018 master’s degree graduate in data science from the School of Informatics and Computing. Majumdar served as the program manager and technology lead for data science and artificial intelligence on the project. She is currently a lead data analyst for data science strategy and cloud migration for the state of Indiana. Mayur Srivastava , a 2019 master’s degree graduate in human-computer interaction from the School of Informatics and Computing. Srivastava played a major role in user and market research and user testing on the project. He is currently a senior user-experience designer for the state of Indiana. I Ting “Tiffany” Tseng , a 2020 master’s degree graduate in human-computer interaction from the School of Informatics and Computing. A user-experience designer and web developer, Tseng was the key player in designing the Zenext app. The team’s other faculty mentor is Lou Lenzi , a professor of practice in the School of Informatics and Computing. The Tech to Protect Challenge was composed of 10 contests and 10 “code-a-thons” across the U.S. The team placed first, second and third for three different projects earlier this year at regional code-a-thons in Chicago in September and in Pittsburgh in November, winning a total of $17,500 and $25,000, respectively. Of the three projects the team had in competition, two were eligible for consideration in the finals. Of those, Zenext was one of only 25 finalists selected to advance to the national award competition that took place May 1. As the top contestant in the Voice AI category, Zenext was awarded $40,000 for receiving a top rating of “Excellent” at the national competition, as well as $30,000 of seed-round funding to support “product maturation and business development.” Kirkley said the IUPUI team’s work stood out due to the strength of their technology and their close partnership with local law enforcement. The Tech to Protect Challenge logo incorporates icons representing various types of first responders.Image courtesy of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Zenext couples natural language processing and artificial intelligence with user-centered design, added Majumdar, whose earlier experiences merging text-to-speech and speech-to-text technology within an Android software-development platform sparked the initial concept for the project. In terms of collaboration, the team worked with the Carmel Police Department throughout the development process. “A police car is really a small mobile office, with a laptop, a printer, a camera – all of which are required for officers to do their job,” said Khan, who, along with other team members, participated in ride-alongs with Carmel police. “Officers need to enter license plates, type and communicate with their colleagues – often at the same time they’re conducting other tasks.” Zenext reduces the risk of distracted driving because, for example, officers can look up license plate numbers through voice command while pursuing drivers, he said. The technology also automates the process of entering the same information into multiple forms and gives police the power to quickly share critical information using hands-free email or radio communications, which is not possible with current equipment. The improvement of officer safety and “just-in-time assistance” that reduces time-on-task through natural language processing was a clear win-win for Zenext, Majumdar said. “I think our collaboration with law enforcement enhanced the authenticity of our project,” she added. “You need to talk to real people about real problems if you want to add value. Along with technology, I think the biggest part of our success in the competition was the human-centered design.” As winners in the national contest, the IUPUI team is eligible to compete for another $70,000 during the Progress Round in November. Over the next six months, the team aims to advance their prototype to the beta test stage, including working with a hardware manufacturer to integrate voice-command software and cloud technology into a custom device and with the Carmel Police Department to employ the technology in field tests. “NIST wants real solutions to real problems and is willing to provide the entrepreneurial funds required to create real products, thereby contributing to the Indiana economy,” Kirkley said. “Beyond funding, I think the greatest value of this competition was the opportunity to develop some real-world solutions to critical issues in public safety.” Author IU Newsroom Kevin Fryling Senior storyteller P: 812-856-2988 E: kfryling@iu.edu Explore media resources Filed under: Artificial intelligence Bicentennial Priority: Catalyzing Research Bicentennial Priority: Towards a Culture of Building and Making Community Engagement IU Indianapolis Strategic Plan Research School of Informatics and Computing School of Science View all tags Plus sign More stories Arts and Humanities , Law and Policy $1 million gift to create Edward G. ‘Ted’ Carmines Professorship in Political Science News at IU May 15 Administration Trustees to meet Sept. 11 in Indianapolis News at IU September 8",

Jointly supported by the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Multicultural Affairs, the fund will: Support 25 grants providing start-up funding of up to $15,000 each for research by IU faculty focused on racial equity and justice. Connect funded researchers with the university’s Foundation Relations, Business Partnerships, and Research Development teams to help the investigators secure external funding for race-related research. Host an on-going Racial Justice Research Workshop series to connect researchers working on racial equity and justice issues and to engage other members of the university community. In an effort to address critical racial equity and justice issues as broadly as possible, funding will be available to IU faculty on all campuses (whether or not tenure-track), without regard for field or discipline. Black researchers or efforts that involve black graduate students or partnerships with black colleagues in other universities, industry, government or not-for-profit organizations are encouraged to apply. “Through the scholarly work of our faculty, the community-building initiatives of our culture centers, and our partnerships and civic engagements with the communities we serve, we are committed to a university where a diverse community can flourish,” said James C. Wimbush, vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural affairs, dean of The University Graduate School, and the Johnson Chair for Diversity and Leadership. “The Racial Justice Research Fund is another effort to empower our faculty to apply their expertise to the translation of justified feelings of anger, frustration and uncertainty into thoughtful dialogue and action that will benefit our local and broader communities.” The Racial Justice Research Fund follows a similar approach to the one IU applied to provide rapid, strategic funding for research addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Research supported by the new fund must be innovative, new or reflect a new application of existing research and, if successful, will contribute to advancing racial justice. “We are all members of an educational community, and as such, we must always, as part of the very core of what we do, face the challenges inherent in understanding and evaluating the ideas, assertions and arguments that come from varied perspectives, traditions, disciplines and beliefs, as we pursue our fundamental mission of searching for knowledge and truth,” Indiana University President Michael A. McRobbie said. “This initiative provides a way to engage some of IU’s best researchers in tackling these vital problems at this pivotal time in our nation’s history.” “Having worked closely with Vice President Wimbush as co-chairs of the committee to restart on-campus research after it was largely stopped by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are again partnering to combat an even greater pandemic that has plagued our nation since its inception,” IU Vice President for Research Fred Cate said. “We know that research can lead to dramatic transformations in health, justice, business and society. The Racial Justice Research Fund is designed to support research necessary to achieving real and lasting racial justice in our community and across our state and nation.” Applications for support may be submitted using a simple online form. They will be reviewed on an on-going basis by a committee, and funding decisions will be made by the vice president for research and the vice president for diversity, equity and multicultural affairs.

      "extracted_content": "Racial and LGBT bias persists in ridesharing platforms despite mitigation efforts, IU research finds For Immediate Release Jul 22, 2020 BLOOMINGTON, Ind. – Despite efforts by ridesharing companies to eliminate or reduce discrimination, research from the Indiana University Kelley School of Business finds that racial and LGBT bias persists. Platforms such as Uber, Lyft and Via responded to drivers’ biased behavior by removing information that could indicate a rider’s gender and race from initial ride requests. However, researchers still found that biases against underrepresented groups and those who indicate support for the LGBT community continued to exist after drivers accepted a ride request – when the rider’s picture would then be displayed. In other words, their efforts shifted some of the biased behavior until after the ride was confirmed, resulting in higher cancellation rates. Understanding whether bias has been removed also is important for ridesharing companies as they not only compete against each other but also with traditional transportation options. Jorge Mejia “Our results confirm that bias at the ride request stage has been removed. However, after ride acceptance, racial and LGBT biases are persistent, while we found no evidence of gender biases,” said Jorge Mejia, assistant professor of operations and decision technologies. “We show that signaling support for a social cause – in our case, the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community – can also impact service provision. Riders who show support for the LGBT community, regardless of race or gender, also experience significantly higher cancellation rates.” Mejia and co-author Chris Parker, assistant professor in the information technology and analytics department at American University in Washington, believe they are the first to use support for social causes as a bias-enabling characteristic. Their article, “ When Transparency Fails: Bias and Financial Incentives in Ridesharing Platforms ,” is published in Management Science. They performed a field experiment on a ridesharing platform in fall 2018 in Washington, D.C. They randomly manipulated rider names, using those traditionally perceived to be white or Black, as well as profile pictures to observe drivers’ behavior patterns in accepting and canceling rides. To illustrate support for LGBT rights, the authors overlaid a rainbow filter on the rider’s picture profile. “We found that underrepresented minorities are more than twice as likely to have a ride canceled than Caucasians; that’s about 3 percent versus 8 percent,” Mejia said. “There was no evidence of gender bias.” Mejia and Parker also varied times of ride requests to study whether peak price periods affected bias. They found that higher prices associated with peak times alleviated some of the bias against riders from the underrepresented group, but not against those who signal support for the LGBT community. They believe that ridesharing companies should use other data-driven solutions to take note of rider characteristics when a driver cancels and penalize the driver for biased behavior. One possible way to punish drivers is to move them down the priority list when they exhibit biased cancellation behavior, so they have fewer ride requests. Alternatively, less-punitive measures may provide “badges” for drivers who exhibit especially low cancellation rates for minority riders. But, ultimately, policymakers may need to intervene, Mejia said. “Investments in reducing bias may not occur organically, as ridesharing platforms are trying to maximize the number of participants in the platform – they want to attract both riders and drivers,” he said. “As a result, it may be necessary for policymakers to mandate what information can be provided to a driver to ensure an unbiased experience, while maintaining the safety of everyone involved, or to create policies that require ridesharing platforms to monitor and remove drivers based on biased behavior. “Careful attention should be paid to these policies both before and after implementation, as unintended consequences are almost sure to follow any simple fix.” IU Research IU’s world-class researchers have driven innovation and creative initiatives that matter for 200 years.

The report offers a comprehensive view of the effects of health disparities on health outcomes across North Carolina and highlights opportunities for improvement and action. \"Every North Carolinian should have the opportunity to live a healthy life, but a health system that fails some, fails us all,\" said NC Health and Human Services Secretary Kody H. Kinsley . \"While Medicaid expansion and recent investments in behavioral health are critical pieces of this work, we must be intentional in uncovering and addressing the health gaps that exist for different communities.\" The Health Disparities Analysis Report focuses on six key topic areas: health care access; chronic disease mental health, substance use, suicide and violence prevention; communicable disease; social drivers of health; and health across the lifespan. The report uses in-depth data to identify and analyze disparities across multiple population groups such as race and ethnicity, disability status and age. It also highlights corresponding strategies that can be used to address identified discrepancies between these groups. \"Reducing health disparities experienced by populations which have been historically marginalized is a huge task that requires partners from every single sector coming together to act,\" said NCDHHS Deputy Secretary for Health Equity and Chief Health Equity Officer Debra Farrington. \"Health disparities are shaped by historical, social, political and other underlying factors, and the first step toward reducing these gaps is to understand their root causes. This report is a critical document that allows our department and our partners to focus on the most severe disparities and strategically plan actions to reduce or eliminate them going forward.\" The release of this report builds upon other key accomplishments and NCDHHS initiatives related to advance fair opportunities for health ensuring every North Carolinian has access to the care they need, when and where they need it. In 2023 North Carolina began Medicaid Expansion , which will provide life-changing health care access to more than 600,000 uninsured and under-insured North Carolinians over the next two years. The department also celebrated a historic $835 million investment in behavioral health, focusing on crisis care, children and families and people involved in the justice system. Most recently, NCDHHS launched a Community and Partner Engagement Initiative , which amplifies the impact of engaging community members and partner organizations within NCDHHS systems, services, programs and policies.

El Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos de Carolina del Norte ha publicado hoy el Informe de análisis sobre las disparidades de salud 2024 . El informe ofrece una visión completa de los efectos de las disparidades de salud en los resultados de salud en todo Carolina del Norte y destaca as oportunidades de mejora y acción. \"Cada habitante de Carolina del Norte debe tener la oportunidad de vivir una vida sana, pero un sistema de salud que falla a algunos nos falla a todos\", dijo el secretario de Salud y Servicios Humanos de Carolina del Norte Kody H. Kinsley . \"Si bien la expansión de Medicaid y las recientes inversiones en salud conductual son piezas fundamentales de este trabajo, debemos ser intencionales en descubrir y abordar las brechas de salud que existen para las diferentes comunidades\". El Informe de análisis sobre las disparidades de salud se centra en seis categorías generales. Estas categorías son acceso a la atención médica; enfermedades crónicas; salud mental, uso de sustancias, prevención del suicidio y la violencia; enfermedades transmisibles; impulsores sociales de la salud y salud a lo largo de la vida. El informe utiliza datos en detalle para identificar y analizar las disparidades entre múltiples grupos de población, como la raza y la etnia, el estatus de discapacidad y la edad. También destaca las estrategias correspondientes que pueden utilizarse para abordar las diferencias identificadas entre estos grupos. \"Reducir las disparidades de salud que sufren las poblaciones que han sido marginadas históricamente es una tarea inmensa que requiere que socios de todos los sectores se unan para actuar\", declaró Debra Farrington, subsecretaria y directora de Equidad en Salud del Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos de Carolina del Norte (NCDHHS, por sus siglas en inglés). \"Las disparidades de salud están determinadas por factores históricos, sociales, políticos y otros factores subyacentes, y el primer paso para reducir estas brechas es comprender sus causas profundas. Este informe es un documento fundamental que permite a nuestro departamento y a nuestros socios centrarse en las disparidades más graves y planificar estratégicamente medidas para reducirlas o eliminarlas de ahora en adelante\". La publicación de este informe se basa en otros logros clave e iniciativas del NCDHHS relacionadas con el avance de oportunidades justas para la salud, asegurando que todos los habitantes de Carolina del Norte tengan acceso a la atención que necesitan, cuando y donde la necesitan. En 2023 Carolina del Norte comenzó la Expansión de Medicaid , que proporcionará acceso a la atención médica que cambiará la vida de más de 600,000 habitantes de Carolina del Norte sin seguro o con seguro insuficiente durante los próximos dos años. El departamento también celebró una inversión histórica de 835 millones de dólares en salud conductual , centrándose en la atención de crisis, los niños y las familias, y las personas involucradas en el sistema de justicia. Recientemente, el NCDHHS puso en marcha una Iniciativa de Participación de la Comunidad y los Colaboradores Comunitarios , que amplifica el impacto de la participación de los miembros de la comunidad y las organizaciones colaboradoras en los sistemas, servicios, programas y políticas del NCDHHS.

Path Forward released the following materials today in support of the expansion of the Model: The claims analysis covering 219 million people from 2018 to 2022 for Medicare and Medicaid and 2018 to 2023 for commercial insurance. A heat map developed by Meadows Institute identifying coverage across the nation. A statement urging Congress to pass the COMPLETE Care Act, legislation that would increase Medicare reimbursement to help cover implementation costs, the biggest barrier to broader adoption. “If every American suffering from depression had access to the Collaborative Care Model, we estimate that approximately 14,000 lives could be saved each year from suicide,” said Andy Keller, the president and CEO of the Meadows Institute. “The Collaborative Care Model is the gold standard for delivering mental health in primary care settings because mental health is, at its core, simply a very important part of health. This model is the single most impactful step we can take to get upstream, before tragedy strikes, to make Americans healthy again.” In the Collaborative Care Model, a team led by a primary care provider and supported by a behavioral health care manager leverages the time of a psychiatric consultant to treat up to eight times more patients. The Collaborative Care Model reduces depression recovery times sevenfold , and more than 90 randomized clinical trials have proven the model’s effectiveness. While start-up implementation costs can be a temporary hurdle, the Collaborative Care Model is 100% sustainable with billing codes once it is up and running. A number of metropolitan areas across the country saw particularly high adoption rates: In Jackson, Michigan, the number of patients with Medicare Advantage participating in the Collaborative Care Model is 23.7 times greater than the national average for Medicare Advantage. In Prescott Valley-Prescott, Arizona, the number of patients with Medicaid and CHIP participating in the Collaborative Care Model is 26.5 times greater than the national average for Medicaid and CHIP. In Sherman-Denison, Texas, the number of patients with commercial insurance participating in the Collaborative Care Model is 8.6 times greater than the average in the commercial market. “The Collaborative Care Model is an evidence-based, effective and innovative method of delivering high-quality mental health care to patients in the primary care setting who need it,” said APA CEO and Medical Director Marketa M. Wills, M.D., M.B.A. “Given the ongoing mental health crisis, the opioid epidemic and high rates of suicide, the widespread implementation of this model is now more essential than ever to reach the growing number of Americans in need of quality mental health services. Simply stated, the more we adopt the Collaborative Care Model, the more patients can access it, and the more lives we will save.” Nearly one in five U.S. adults experience a mental health disorder each year and 20% of high school students report seriously considering suicide. The findings arrive amid a critical moment for the nation’s mental health.

But assessing how well a state performs on average can mask the profound inequities that many people experience. This report evaluates disparities in health and health care across racial and ethnic groups, both within states and between U.S. states. We collected data for 25 indicators of health system performance, specifically focusing on health outcomes, access to health care, and quality and use of health care services for Black, white, Hispanic, American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), and Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) populations. We then produced a health system performance “score” for each of the five racial and ethnic groups in every state where we were able to make direct comparisons between those groups and between groups in other states. (For complete details on our methods, see How We Measure Performance of States’ Health Care Systems for Racial and Ethnic Groups .) Our hope is that policymakers, health system leaders, and community stakeholders will use this tool to investigate the impact of current and past health policies on different racial and ethnic groups and to take steps to ensure an equitable health care system for the future. Overview of Health Disparities in the United States Profound racial and ethnic disparities in health, well-being, and life expectancy have long been the norm in the United States. These disparities are especially stark for Black and AIAN people, who live fewer years, on average, than white and Hispanic people 1 and are more likely to die from treatable conditions, more likely to die during or after pregnancy and suffer serious pregnancy-related complications, more likely to lose children in infancy, 2 and are at higher risk for many chronic health conditions, from diabetes to hypertension. 3 The COVID-19 pandemic only made things worse. Its disproportionate impact on Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people caused a sharper decline in average life expectancy since 2020 for these groups compared to white people. 4 Factors contributing to health disparities . Deep racial and ethnic disparities in health are driven by factors inside and outside state health care systems. For example, in many communities where people of color live, poverty rates are higher than average, levels of pollution and crime are elevated, and green spaces are few — all key contributors to health disparities. 5 A lack of affordable, quality health care options, meanwhile, can make it difficult to get timely treatment — a barrier that people of color disproportionately face. Black, Hispanic, and AIAN people are also less likely than other groups to have health insurance, more likely to delay care because of costs, and more likely to incur medical debt. 6 And they are less likely to have a usual source of care or to regularly receive timely preventive services like vaccinations. 7 Studies show as well that many people of color contend with interpersonal racism and discrimination in health care settings and more often receive worse medical care than white patients. 8 According to an assessment by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Black patients received worse care than white patients on 52 percent of quality measures in 2023. 9 The study also found marked disparities in quality of care and patient safety with respect to heart disease, cancer, stroke, 10 maternal health outcomes, 11 pain management, 12 and surgery. 13 The policy choices that federal, state, and local leaders have made over many decades have led to economic suppression, unequal educational access, and widespread housing segregation, all of which have contributed in their own ways to worse health outcomes for people of color. 14 While the nation’s steady and slow progress toward universal, comprehensive coverage has narrowed racial and ethnic disparities in coverage and access to care, it has not eliminated them. In particular, the 10 states that have yet to expand eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), have the largest coverage gaps by race and ethnicity. A Note on the Racial and Ethnic Categories Used in This Report None of the five racial and ethnic groups discussed in this report are homogeneous: each encompasses distinct communities with a range of cultures, experiences, socioeconomic levels, and immigration challenges. Such groupings thus conceal substantial differences, as evidenced by the great variation seen in health insurance coverage rates among Asian Americans. 15 Aggregation of these categories was necessary to obtain sufficient sample sizes for our analysis of state health system performance, but state and local stakeholders should interpret the findings within the context of their communities. Our report should be considered only as a starting point for more targeted research exploration and policy development. Findings Racial and ethnic disparities are pervasive across all states. Health care system performance varies widely by race and ethnicity, both within states and between states (Exhibit 1). Mirroring national patterns, substantial health",

      "extracted_content": "April 18, 2024 Racial and ethnic disparities in Indiana’s health care system persist Elizabeth Gabriel The Commonwealth Fund, a private U.S. foundation which supports independent research on health care issues, released the 2024 State Health Disparities Report. Photo from Pixabay A new report released Thursday shows racial and ethnic disparities persist in health care access, quality, and outcomes across the nation, including in Indiana. The Commonwealth Fund, a private U.S. foundation which supports independent research on health care issues, released the 2024 State Health Disparities Report . It compares medical outcomes for people of different races and ethnicities in each state, and ranks how well each state’s health system addresses medical conditions for each racial and ethnic group. In Indiana, White people experienced the highest health system performance, scoring in the 64th percentile among all population groups nationally. Black people experienced the lowest health system performance in the state, scoring in the 14th percentile. However, researchers found Indiana has less severe racial and ethnic health disparities compared to other states in the Great Lakes region. The findings highlight continued disparities in Indiana health outcome metrics including life expectancy. David Radley, a senior scientist with The Commonwealth Fund, said health disparities are related to a variety of factors like a lack of affordable, quality health care options and health insurance. “Where a person lives matters, and this is especially true for people of color,” Radley said. “We also see big differences in people’s abilities to access care. Not only do uninsured rates vary from state to state, we also find big differences within states where we see large coverage gaps between people from different racial and ethnic groups.” In Indiana, 21% of Hispanic adults are uninsured, compared to 12% of uninsured Black adults and 8% of White, Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander adults. That leads to residents putting off medical care because they don’t want to incur medical debt. Compared to other states, Indiana’s health care system was ranked worse than average for different racial groups, where there was enough data to make a calculation: Indiana ranked 22nd of 31 states in health system performance for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people. Indiana ranked 34th of 39 states in health system performance for Black people. Indiana ranked 28th of 47 states in health system performance for Hispanic people. Indiana ranked 38th of 51 states in health system performance for White people. Inequities for people of color were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and led to a sharper decline in average life expectancy compared to White people. Additionally, communities of color are more likely to die from medical issues including treatable conditions or during or after pregnancy; and are at a higher risk for chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension. Disparities in premature mortality — when people die before the age 75 due to health conditions that are considered preventable and treatable — occurred at a higher rate among American Indian and Black people compared to other groups. These deaths are higher for both Black and White community members in Midwest states like Kentucky and Missouri, compared to other states. In order to address these issues, researchers suggest implementing policies that ensure affordable, comprehensive, and equitable health insurance coverage for all; strengthening primary care services; lowering the administrative burden for patients and providers and investing in social services. Laurie Zephyrin, senior vice president of advancing health equity for The Commonwealth Fund, said diversifying the health care workforce and implementing community health workers are some of the critical changes that are needed to improve the health care system. “Quality in health care and delivery of health care are really critical to address and need to be improved,” Zephyrin said. “You really can’t have quality without having equity, and it’s important for delivery systems to partner with patients and community members to fully understand the needs and experiences of the people that they serve.” Researchers hope policymakers, health system leaders, and community members will work to provide a more equitable health care system by addressing the impact of health policies on different racial and ethnic groups.

      "extracted_content": "Residential addiction treatment for adolescents is scarce and expensive Monday, January 8, 2024 Residential addiction treatment for adolescents is scarce and expensive Access to residential addiction treatment centers caring for U.S. adolescents under 18 years old in the United States is limited and costly, according to a new study supported by the National Institutes of Health. Researchers found that only about half (54%) of the residential addiction treatment facilities that they contacted had a bed immediately available, and for those that had a waitlist, the average estimated time before a bed opened was 28 days. In addition, the average daily cost per day of treatment was $878, with close to half (48%) of the facilities that provided information requiring partial or full payment upfront. On average, the quoted cost of a month’s stay at a residential addiction treatment facility was over $26,000. Published in Health Affairs , this study was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), both part of NIH, and led by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). The results build on previous research revealing that only one in four residential treatment centers caring for U.S. adolescents under 18 years old provide buprenorphine, a medication to treat opioid use disorder. “The ability to access timely, evidence-based treatment for addiction can be a matter of life or death, and the current system too often fails young people,” said Nora Volkow, M.D., director of NIDA. “We need to make access to timely, affordable, and evidence-based care the norm across treatment settings.” In 2022, an estimated 2.2 million people between the ages of 12 and 17 had a substance use disorder in the past year, with 265,000 having an opioid use disorder, according to the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health , which is produced by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). In addition, previous data have reported a dramatic rise in overdose deaths among teens between 2010 and 2021 , which remained elevated well into 2022 . This increase is largely attributed to illicit fentanyl, a potent synthetic drug, contaminating the supply of counterfeit pills made to resemble prescription medications. Residential treatment is one part of a broader continuum of care for adolescents with substance use disorders, in addition to treatment provided in outpatient, primary care, and other settings. However, little is known about the accessibility or cost of residential treatment for adolescents with opioid use disorder. To address this gap, researchers at OHSU sought to characterize treatment access and costs of U.S. residential treatment facilities that treat patients with opioid use disorder who are younger than age 18. Using the FindTreatment.gov database maintained by SAMHSA, and SpyFu, a search analytics company that compiles data on search engine advertisements, the researchers identified a list of 354 centers across the U.S. that indicated that they provided residential addiction treatment services to people under the age of 18 to include in the analysis. Researchers called these facilities to inquire about treatment and services offered as potential users of these services for a 16-year-old with a recent non-fatal fentanyl overdose. Between October and December 2022, the study team called the facilities in a random order and confirmed that 160 (45%) of these facilities provided residential treatment to patients under the age of 18. Of the 160 residential addiction treatment facilities found to provide treatment to young patients, the researchers found that 66 facilities (41%) were for-profit, and 94 facilities (59%) were nonprofit. For-profit treatment centers were more likely to have space immediately available (77%) compared to nonprofit facilities (39%) but at roughly triple the cost (on average, $1,211 reported daily cost for for-profit facilities vs. $395 for nonprofit facilities). Sixty-five facilities (40%) estimated the number of days until a bed opened. The average wait time for a bed in a for-profit facility was 19 days, and the average wait time for a bed in a nonprofit facility was 31 days. The authors report that just over half of the facilities (57%) accepted Medicaid, with a stark contrast by facility profit orientation: One in five for-profits accepted Medicaid, compared with four in five nonprofits. In addition, in 23 states, researchers did not identify any adolescent residential treatment centers that accepted Medicaid. Overall, 57% of all facilities that accepted Medicaid reported a waitlist, compared to 19% of facilities that did not accept Medicaid. Only seven states had a facility that accepted Medicaid, had a bed open the same day, and offered buprenorphine. “From our previous work, we know that the majority of residential treatment centers treating adolescents do not offer buprenorphine, the one medication for opioid use disorder that is approved for use in adolescents,” said lead author Caroline King, M.D., Ph.D., who conducted the study as a medical student at OHSU and now serves as an emergency medicine resident in the Yale School of Medicine. “These new results give us an even fuller picture, highlighting that not only is the care in residential treatment facilities often incomplete, but it can also be costly and hard to access.” The authors note that further research is needed to identify how to best expand access to affordable, evidence-based treatment for adolescents with opioid use disorder. “When your kid is in a crisis and needs treatment, it can be terrifying to know where to turn. Many parents or family members who look for residential care find the experience profoundly disheartening,” said Senior Author Ryan Cook, Ph.D., research and training scientist for addiction medicine at OHSU. “Systems-level changes are needed to ensure effective, affordable treatment options for adolescents.” HHS is committed to expanding access to care for adolescents in need of substance use disorder treatment and support. In addition to residential treatment, there are other treatment options for children and adolescents covered by Medicaid. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) has engaged in a multifaceted approach to strengthen access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment for children and adolescents enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP including through several on-going initiatives to improve access through schools. In addition, CMS is working closely with state Medicaid agencies to ensure compliance with the Early, Periodic, Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit that requires state to provide children and adolescents access to all medically necessary care including care for mental health conditions and substance use disorders.

Areas with higher household incomes and greater educational attainment consistently showed higher digital engagement. These findings challenge the assumption that digital divides disappear once basic broadband infrastructure is widely available. The digital divide is typically understood as the gap between those with access to Internet infrastructure and those without. My colleague’s recent research, though, reveals that the real story goes deeper, highlighting stark differences in how digital technologies are used. This ‘new digital divide’ has significant consequences for social equality, as it exacerbates existing disparities and creates new ones. It also alters economic opportunities, as those with limited digital skills may be left behind in the job market. Furthermore, it affects civic participation, as those who are less digitally literate may struggle to engage in online civic activities. A Substantial Divide Exists Between Urban and Rural Communities Our research (see paper ), conducted in partnership between the Microsoft AI for Good Lab, Harvard Business School, and the Wharton School, offers an unprecedentedly granular look at digital usage in the United States. We used anonymized telemetry data from 40 million (non-business) Windows devices in homes, collected during software updates. These data extend far beyond traditional metrics, such as Internet connectivity or computer ownership, delving into how people interact with technology. This includes activities such as browsing the Internet, using social media, creating documents, and coding software. What emerged from our analysis is that a substantial divide exists between urban and rural communities, not just in infrastructure, but also in our measures of usage and proxies for digital literacy—how effectively and creatively individuals use technology. To capture these differences, we developed two distinct indices: The Media and Information Composite Index (MCI) measures general computing and media usage, including activities such as browsing, word processing, and emailing. The Content Creation and Computation Composite Index (CCI) measures specialized activities, including software development and graphic design. Figure 1 demonstrates these geographical disparities, with urban areas generally showing higher levels of usage than rural regions. However, even within major metropolitan areas, such as Chicago (shown in the right panel), substantial variations persist across different ZIP codes, emphasizing that the digital divide is far more severe than infrastructure differences might suggest (broadband availability is much more homogeneous in comparison). Figure 1 — Spatial distribution of media and information composite index, content creation and computation composite index, and broadband availability. ( A ) Media and information composite index across US countries (left) and Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN ZIP codes (right). ( B ) Content creation and computation index across US countries (left) and Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-NL ZIP codes (right). ( C ) Broadband availability across US counties (left) and Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN ZIP codes (right). What Factors Drive These Divides? These findings challenge the assumption that digital divides disappear once basic broadband infrastructure is widely available. Some areas with good Internet infrastructure still experience surprisingly low digital usage. Conversely, regions with robust digital skills can leverage technology for economic and social advancement despite infrastructural limitations. In our analysis, income and education levels emerged as critical influences. Areas with higher household incomes and greater educational attainment consistently showed higher digital engagement on both indices. This suggests that digital usage is closely tied to socioeconomic status, reinforcing existing inequalities. This approach means moving beyond the traditional policy focus on hardware and connectivity. Policymakers, educators, and community organizations must invest in digital literacy programs that cater to the diverse needs of communities. Furthermore, continuous measurement is critical to ensure that initiatives effectively address real-world needs and reassure the audience about their adaptability to changing technological landscapes. This includes continuously monitoring digital usage trends. By making our detailed indices publicly available , we invite further research and policy formulation. The Digital Divide is Evolving Bridging this new divide requires understanding not just who has Internet access, but how they use it. Our findings (read paper ) underscore the need for localized strategies that prioritize education, training, and ongoing support to harness technology’s potential for positive change.

      "extracted_content": "Champaign County Kids Are Getting More Support This School Year No internet. No computer. That may sound like a punishment doled out by parents to kids who aren’t doing their chores. But for millions of kids, it’s an everyday reality that makes it challenging to succeed in school. The digital divide in education is the gap between students who have reliable access to an adequate device and reliable internet and those who don’t. The gap has existed for decades – ever since personal computers gained popularity – but during the COVID-19 pandemic our community saw how deep the challenge runs. United Way of Champaign County is working to close the digital divide. During the past years as schools moved to remote learning, we provided funding to organizations that give out laptops, tablets, printers, etc. thanks to generous donors like you. As the new school year begins we are planning to increase these efforts so more students in our community can thrive. Here are four reasons we are investing in closing the digital divide. 1. Closing the divide increases racial equity According to Common Sense Media, 15 to 16 million students don’t have access to adequate devices or internet connection. That’s about 30% of all students in the U.S. But when the numbers are broken out by race, it becomes clearer students of color disproportionately have to deal with the challenges of the digital divide. Students of color represent about 40% of the total population, but 55% of Black, Latinx and Native American students are part of the disconnected populations. Native Americans face the greatest challenge to access to devices and the internet; 37% of Indigenous students lack adequate connectivity. Black, Latinx and Native American students may not have connectivity because of discriminatory housing practices that led to them growing up in neighborhoods that are under-resourced and lack high-speed internet, their families may have faced discriminatory pay practices that kept them from higher earning jobs making personal devices unaffordable, or they may face more language barriers that make adoption more difficult. Closing the digital divide gives students of color better opportunities to navigate these obstacles caused by systemic racism and more chances to thrive. 2. Increasing access supports kids in rural areas Students in rural areas already face many challenges. They often attend under-resourced schools, must travel long distances to attend classes and schools struggle to attract top-quality teachers. The lack of access to devices or hardware is one more challenge rural students must overcome. Similarly to students of color, rural students are disproportionately impacted by the digital divide. Common Sense Media notes that rural students makeup 12% of the total school population but comprise 20% of the disconnected population. Unlike other common services such as electricity or telephone access, internet connection is not treated as a public utility. That means demand and interest in profits have largely determined where and when infrastructure like broadband internet are introduced to communities. Rural communities are often left out of that conversation, hurting economic growth, ability to attract new residents and local students. Addressing the digital divide can help overcome these challenges to give rural students more opportunities to succeed and be prepared for a digitally-based world. 3. There is a connection between access and higher GPAs Access to the internet and devices might seem like a distraction for some kids, but research shows it also increases student grade performance. Researchers from Michigan State University connected higher grade point averages (GPA) with access to broadband internet and adequate at-home devices. During the global pandemic, kids without access struggled to stay engaged as schools moved to remote learning. Slow internet, having to share devices with siblings, participating on smartphones instead of laptops all contributed. But these challenges extend beyond the pandemic. As more schools incorporate assignments that require online research, use digital tools to enhance learning and incorporate technology overall, students without at-home access will continue to fall behind. 4. Kids need digital skills for the workforce Helping kids thrive in the workplace tomorrow starts by closing the digital divide today. A study from the University of Miami found that students with higher GPAs, those that have adequate access to technology, have higher earning potential. The study shows the multi-generational impact of increasing connectivity for individuals. On top of the benefits for individuals, when students have more opportunities to secure high paying jobs that strengthens our local economy. A skilled, high performing workforce is essential to keeping our region thriving today as well as decades into the future. There is still much to be done to close the digital divide. But together with generous donors, committed volunteers and community partners United Way of Champaign County can continue to help kids thrive. To stay up to date with the latest on what we’re doing to close the digital divide and other ways we’re helping improve the health, education and financial stability of every person in Champaign County.

By Lori Adams , Brand Contributor and David Eckard , Brand Contributor. for Nokia BRANDVOICE Storytelling and expertise from marketers | Paid Program Aug 12, 2024, 11:15am EDT Aug 12, 2024, 02:12pm EDT Share Save From the way we learn, work, and shop to how we stay entertained and access critical services like banking, healthcare, and more, our lives are increasingly digitalized. Yet 2.6 billion people — about one-third of the world’s population — still lack the connectivity needed to access digital experiences and opportunities. Many live in rural or remote regions that remain underserved despite the rapid growth of the Internet over the last thirty years. Getty Bridging this digital divide is a challenge, but one worth taking on — and the time to act is now. As remote work opportunities grow and technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) continue to evolve and open new possibilities, those caught in the digital divide will be left further and further behind. But progress is possible when governments, service providers, and communities work together, backed by support from initiatives like the United States Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program. Rural communities still struggle with internet access The impact of the digital divide, which persists in even the most developed countries, was magnified during the COVID-19 pandemic. As people scrambled to learn, work, access healthcare, and socialize from home, we all came to realize the value of reliable, affordable, broadband access. It’s what kept families, industries, and economies going — except in places where large segments of the population remained unconnected. Globally, only 50% of people living in rural areas have access to the internet compared to 81% of people in urban areas. That means where you live substantially determines the digital opportunities you can experience and benefit from. While the gap isn’t as large in the United States, it is still substantial, with more than 40 million Americans lacking broadband access. The counties with the greatest digital divides are predominantly rural , even in cases where people in these communities have some form of internet access, costs can be high, and options are very limited — and the access available might not even reach the download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second required to be considered true broadband. How programs like BEAD can help Over the last few years, significant progress has been made in bridging the digital divide in the United States, as illustrated by the National Broadband Map . This initiative by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) tracks locations across the country that are unserved or underserved by broadband. Since 2020, the FCC has seen more and more locations on its map shift to the “served” label as communities undertake connectivity-related projects. A big reason is that federal and state governments have pushed over a billion dollars of subsidy into the market for broadband infrastructure aimed at closing the digital divide. BEAD is one program that has yet to have an impact. Established by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act , BEAD makes $42.5 billion in funding available to help connect all Americans to high-speed internet services. The BEAD program administered through the National Telecommunications & Information Administration has allocated funding to US states and territories that will be distributing the funds to service providers through competitive grant programs. The BEAD program is a fiber-first program as fiber optic networks provide an almost infinite amount of capacity allowing operators to utilize their investment for generations to come. These fiber optic networks conform to international standards and are completely passive thereby making them the lowest power technology for connecting homes and businesses. As newer fiber optic technologies become available, operators and consumers can simply attach the devices to the network and harness this capacity. Chattanooga – a model of a digital renaissance Over a century and a half ago the railroad transformed the United States by connecting communities and bringing prosperity. As we look to the future, the “railroad of the future” will not be made of steel but of glass bringing new life into these communities. Chattanooga, made famous by these railroads of yesteryear, is experiencing a digital renaissance by being home to some of the fastest and most widely available broadband in America. The broadband network of Chattanooga is owned and managed by the municipal government and its public power utility, EPB. The municipality believes that Internet access should be treated the same as any other vital utility, like water or electricity. While BEAD is focused on reaching the most rural locations in the US, communities are funding network deployments in many ways. So, in 2010, through a combination of bonds, grants, and loans, EPB built a high-speed fiber network as part of its planned revamp of Chattanooga’s electric grid communications network. The result: the first fiber network in North America capable of delivering gigabit per second speeds to every home, school, or business in the city. Working with Nokia, the “Gig City” has since evolved to become the first city in the United States to offer speeds of 25 gigabits per second, scaling its broadband services to meet the dynamic, changing needs of the city’s residents and its burgeoning business innovation district that was once served by these bustling railroads. Community-wide access to fiber connectivity has enabled Chattanooga to experience a digital renaissance transforming this former manufacturing city into a thriving tech hub of the 21 st century, attracting multi-national companies as well as gig-professionals from across the world. Just a decade after its deployment, Chattanooga’s fiber optic infrastructure had generated $2.69 billion in economic and community benefits , including nearly 10,000 new jobs. It also helped keep unemployment low during the pandemic, with people and businesses able to seamlessly transition to remote work. More importantly, it has brought connectivity to people who never had it before. Through the HCS EdConnect program, high-speed home internet has been made available to more than 30,000 students, at no cost to their families. The city also launched Tech Goes Home , which has provided more than 4,500 residents with 15 hours of digital skills training, a low-cost Chromebook or tablet, and assistance in getting access to affordable home internet. An open-access network connects Kenosha While Chattanooga and EPB set a great example for communities with visionary municipal power utilities, it isn’t always replicable across the country. Sixteen states currently restrict the ability of municipalities to own and/or operate broadband networks. Fortunately, there are other approaches available to communities looking to address the digital divide. One option is for municipalities to create a public-private partnership, working with an internet service provider who can bring additional resources, operational skills, and capabilities needed to successfully build and run the network. There are many different models of public-private partnerships but one of the more successful ones is through an open-access network partnership whereby a company invests in the infrastructure and then makes the network available to service providers through leases. Recognizing the negative impacts of the digital divide on their community, officials in Kenosha, Wisconsin, partnered with open-access provider SiFi Networks to build a high-speed fiber-optic network throughout the city. As part of the FiberCity program launched in 2022, SiFi Networks is investing $100 million to bring 10 gigabits per second connectivity to Kenosha’s 40,000 homes, businesses, and institutions.

And a majority of students–70 percent–are concerned about having enough money to purchase the technology needed for college. “Although some gains in high school students’ technological device and internet access have occurred since ACT first investigated the digital divide in 2018, device and internet access of students with lower family incomes is lagging that of students with higher family incomes,” said Jeff Schiel, Ph.D, an ACT lead research scientist and author of the report. “There is also a concerning new data point: Nearly three quarters of students are worried they won’t be able to pay for the technology they need for college.” The new report, How High School Students Use and Perceive Technology at Home and School , examines high school students’ access to and use of technology and how access and use vary among student groups. The study continues the research that ACT published six years ago, The Digital Divide and Educational Equity . Nearly all (96 percent) high school students reported having access to a smartphone at home, and 87 percent had access to a laptop computer. But students from higher-income families were significantly more likely than those from lower-income families to report having home access to desktop computers, laptop computers, tablets, and smartphones. Gains across all income groups indicate that more students are now connected, but disparities in access to technology remain significant. “A large number of students reported being at least moderately confident in using technological devices to find information for schoolwork. However, students from higher-income families expressed higher confidence and were more likely to trust the information they find online compared to their peers from lower-income families,” Dr. Schiel added. “Speaking of trust, in another recent study, we found that many students did not use AI tools because they did not trust the information provided by the tools. As AI and digital content become increasingly prevalent, ensuring that students can critically evaluate and trust the information they consume will be important for their academic and career success.” Students’ family income category was also significantly related to home internet access. Seventy percent of students with low family incomes (less than $36,000 per year) reported having a monthly cellular data plan for home internet access, compared with 64 percent of students with moderate family incomes ($36,000 to $100,000 per year) and 58 percent of students with high family incomes (more than $100,000 per year). This indicates that lower-income students are more likely to rely solely on cellular data plans and lack access to more robust and stable internet options, such as broadband. “As technology becomes increasingly integral to students’ learning, the persistence of the digital divide means disparities in access continue to prevent students from engaging in online learning and completing assignments,” ACT CEO Janet Godwin said. “This divide also could affect students’ ability to develop digital literacy skills, which are essential to preparing students for the challenges of consuming content in an AI-driven world. We are seeing gains in critical areas of technology access compared to our 2018 findings, but they are not enough to bridge this divide. We must prioritize ensuring equitable technology and quality internet access for all students to support their future success in a digital-first world.” The report is based on a December 2023 survey of national ACT test registrants. Key findings: Students from higher-income families were more likely to have home access to desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Ninety-two percent of students with high family incomes reported having laptops, compared to 88 percent of students from moderate-income families and 76 percent of those from low-income families. The percentage of students with low family incomes who had access to two, three, or four devices at home was 10 percentage points larger than in 2018 (82 percent vs. 72 percent, respectively). The percentage of students with moderate family incomes who had access to two, three, or four devices at home increased from 86 percent to 93 percent, a gain of 7 percentage points. Black and Hispanic students were more likely to access the internet via monthly cellular data plans (67 percent and 66 percent) than were Asian and white students (56 percent and 58 percent). Dial-up access was more common among Black and Hispanic students (5 percent and 4 percent) than Asian and white students (3 percent and 2 percent). This press release originally appeared online .

      "extracted_content": "In wake of pandemic, Mass. achievement gap has widened Fri, 05/24/2024 While students across the country continue to struggle to make up the learning loss from the pandemic, with many states seeing the gulf separating the achievement of poor and non-poor students growing larger, a study led by researchers at Harvard and Stanford universities says Massachusetts has the seen the largest widening of that gap of any the states they examined. Massachusetts students lost the equivalent of about two-thirds of a typical year of math learning and two-fifths of a year in reading from 2019 to 2022, according to the report from the Center for Education Research Policy at Harvard and the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford. Many of the state’s Gateway Cities, home to lots of the state’s poorer students, saw declines of as much as a full year of learning. While many districts began to see achievement gains from 2022 to 2023 – the first full year when students returned to in-person learning – many Gateway Cities saw achievement levels continue to drop, making the achievement gap even larger now than it was before the pandemic. “No one in Massachusetts wants to leave poor kids footing the bill for the pandemic, but that is the path we are on,” said Thomas Kane, faculty director of Harvard’s Center for Education Policy Research and one of the study’s co-authors. The gap within Massachusetts between poor and non-poor students is now roughly half a grade wider than it was in 2019, according to the analysis of achievement trends across 15 states, a finding that shows just how much harder the school disruption hit lower-income students here – and how uneven the recovery from it has been. Five of the 15 states actually recorded a narrowing of the poor/non-poor gap in one or both subjects. Kane says without focused effort by districts and the state to address the growing achievement gap, research suggests poor students in Massachusetts will face setbacks tied to the pandemic that extend into adulthood, affecting everything from lifetime earnings to incarceration rates. Many districts with lots of students from higher-income households began to see achievement start to bounce back between 2022 to 2023, following large drops during the pandemic. In Longmeadow, for example, a well-off suburb of Springfield, proficiency rates for grade 3-8 reading went from 61 percent in 2022 to 64 percent in 2023 and in math rose from 58 percent to 65 percent. In many districts with large populations of low-income students, however, it’s been a very different story.

Wisconsin’s Black-to-white opportunity gap, however, remains among the widest in the nation. “While the NAEP results highlight some successes, today’s release serves as an urgent wake-up call for our state – one that demands we act with greater urgency to support our children, educators, and schools,” Dr. Underly said. “We have the power to achieve lasting change, but it starts with a fundamental commitment to properly investing in our public schools, rather than continuing the cycle of underfunding them, as our legislature has chosen to do for far too long.” The NAEP measures the academic performance of students across the United States, providing a snapshot of student achievement in mathematics and reading across fourth and eighth grade. The NAEP is separate from Wisconsin’s statewide standardized assessment – the Forward Exam. Information on how the two assessments differ is available in this NAEP resource . Detailed, comprehensive NAEP data released today can be found on its website . In mathematics, Wisconsin eighth graders performed just behind the Department of Defense and Massachusetts and ahead of all other states and jurisdictions. In the same subject, Wisconsin fourth graders were consistent with the national average. In reading, Wisconsin fourth and eighth graders did not experience a statistically significant change compared to 2022, while the nation experienced statistically significant declines in both grades. Both grades of Wisconsin students on average performed at or above the nation in the subject. Wisconsin 2023 Act 20 , which reimagines the way students are taught to read across the state, is being implemented this school year, while NAEP was administered in spring 2024. To date, the legislature has not released nearly $50 million in approved funding to support schools in purchasing curriculum and implementing specific instructional methods in accordance with Act 20. The NAEP showed that Wisconsin still has the widest Black-to-white opportunity gaps of all states in the nation in all grades and subjects. New data and maps created by the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction detail the relationship between schools with high percentages of economically disadvantaged students and school performance. Additional resources are available on the DPI’s website . “Our educators are leaving our state or the profession in alarming numbers, and this exodus is disproportionately affecting our most vulnerable schools, where economically disadvantaged students face the greatest challenges,” Dr. Underly said. “There is an undeniable link between poverty and academic achievement, and these NAEP results show that once again. We cannot afford to ignore the reality that until we bridge these gaps, we will continue to shortchange our kids’ futures.” In November, the DPI submitted its 2025-27 Biennial Budget request , which seeks to invest more than $4 billion in funding to Wisconsin public schools. Dr. Underly’s proposals include historic funding to increase the special education rate to 90 percent by 2027, to provide universal free school meals to all students so they have the nourishment necessary to succeed academically, to support growing student mental health needs , to improve the educator workforce and help schools recruit and retain high-quality teachers, to build off of Act 20 and ensure kids have the ability to read, to expand career and technical education programming , and more. “The upcoming biennial budget is a defining moment for our students and their families,” Dr. Underly said. “The legislature has let public school funding fall behind - we cannot expect to see meaningful improvement for our kids if we continue to invest too little. It’s time to make the right choices for the future of our state, and that starts with fully funding our public schools and giving every child the opportunity to succeed.” Official Release dpinr2025-05.pdf Share on Twitter Share on Facebook",

The data shows that New York students remain below pre-pandemic levels in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math, which are critical indicators of future academic success. It also exposes alarming achievement gaps between white and Asian students and their Black and Latinx peers. Most concerning, more than half of Black and Latinx students in New York scored Below Basic both in fourth grade Reading and eighth grade Math. These results indicate a dire situation for students. Scoring Below Basic—the lowest performance level— shows that students lack even partial mastery of the fundamental knowledge and skills needed for future success. Except for fourth grade math, New York’s NAEP scores in reading and math have stagnated or declined over the past 25 years. These results make it clear that current approaches, especially in middle grades, are failing students. We cannot continue with the same strategies and expect different outcomes. Notable NAEP Reading and Math Results: 41% of 4th grade students scored Below Basic in reading, with 55% of Black students and 51% of Latinx students scoring Below Basic. 35% of 8th grade students scored Below Basic in reading, with 42% of Black 8th graders and 47% of Latinx 8th graders scoring Below Basic. 28% of 4th grade students scored Below Basic in math, with 44% of Black students and 39% of Latinx students scoring Below Basic. 42% of 8th grade students scored Below Basic in math, with 56% of Black students and 59% of Latinx students scoring Below Basic. EdTrust-New York calls on state and district leaders to take immediate action to address these disparities by prioritizing evidence-based strategies and providing targeted support for students with the greatest needs. We urge them to: Invest in Literacy: Implement comprehensive literacy programs, including for older students, aligned with the science of reading. Revise the Foundation Aid Formula: Conduct a thorough, equity-focused review to ensure funding reaches districts and students with the greatest needs. Support High-Impact Tutoring: Expand tutoring programs in reading and math to address unfinished learning. Expand College in High School Programs: Increase access to College in High School opportunities to improve college persistence and degree attainment among underrepresented groups. While these results are unacceptable, EdTrust-New York knows that with the right advocacy, all students can succeed. Research shows that high-quality, culturally relevant instruction—focused on equity and data—is key to improving outcomes. States like Louisiana and Mississippi have already demonstrated the power of this approach, and we are committed to working with state and district leaders to ensure all schools, educators, students, and families receive the support they deserve. ### About EdTrust-New York: EdTrust-New York is dedicated to eliminating equity and opportunity gaps that hinder students from reaching their full potential. We focus on ensuring that all students, especially Black, Latinx, Native American students and those from low-income backgrounds achieve high levels of success from early childhood through college.

Chandra Kelsey of Wallingford, Connecticut, is a mother of three who works full-time as a program director at Yale's School of Public Health and sometimes takes on a second job to make ends meet. In their household, two people take home a total of $150,000, but it's often not enough. \"That's not what you bring home after taxes. You know we have mortgage, insurance. We've got one kid on the way to college, one in college. Something as small as a $1,000 expense could throw things off significantly,\" Kelsey said. For Kelsey, food insecurity is a lifelong trauma, having visited food banks as a child. \"To be in a position where you are doing OK and then you lose everything the next day — it's humbling, it's scary,\" Kelsey said. Kelsey has relied on help from Connecticut Foodshare, the state's largest food bank, on and off for over a decade. She and two of her children now give back by volunteering there. Nationally, more than 50 million people need help getting food from charities, according to food bank network Feeding America. In Connecticut, one in eight people are food insecure, according to Connecticut Foodshare. \"They're your neighbor. They're your friend. They could be your family,\" said Connecticut Foodshare CEO Jason Jakubowski. Jakubowski said demand for their food jumped 23% last year. He expects another double-digit increase this year. Recently, he's seen more demand from people with higher incomes who need help. \"Many of them come to us and say, 'I donated to you for years and I never in a million years thought I would have to use this service,'\" Jabukowski said. When asked what has changed, he said, \"A lot of economic unpredictability.\" Kelsey is scared about her job in the wake of uncertainty over continued government funding of universities such as hers. \"We are trying to be very cognizant that it could be around the corner,\" Kelsey said. In its own way, Connecticut Foodshare is feeling food insecure. Government DOGE cuts last month slashed nearly $2 million dollars from its food budget. Jakubowski said there's no way to replace the funding, but he still has hope. \"We still live in America. People always step up to the plate. It may not be enough food, but we're gonna keep doing whatever we can to try to provide,\" Jabukowski said.

Food insecurity has been rising significantly in recent years—from 10.2% of American households (13.5 million households) in 2021 to 12.8% (17 million households) in 2022. The most recent data shows that hunger rates are continuing to increase. USDA reports that 13.5% (18 million) of households in the U.S. were food insecure during 2023—a statistically significant increase from the previous year. That translates to more than 47 million people , including more than seven million children, struggling to get enough food. Related News EJI Expands Anti-Hunger Work with Mobile Grocery Program Since EJI started providing support to people experiencing food insecurity in 2022, the number of families seeking assistance has skyrocketed. Food banks already grappling with rising needs told Reuters they will now have less food to distribute after USDA made more than $1 billion in federal funding cuts and pauses earlier this month. USDA has paused half the funding ($500 million) for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), a core nutrition program that purchases U.S. commodities for emergency food providers that help households obtain sufficient nutrition, Reuters reports . In 2023 alone, according to Feeding America, more than 50 million people turned to food banks, food pantries, and community organizations for food assistance. USDA also cancelled two federal programs that helped schools and food banks buy fresh food directly from local farmers—the Local Food Purchase Assistance (LFPA) program, which would have funded about $500 million this year for food banks, and the $660 million Local Food for Schools program. In a letter to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins this week, a group of 26 U.S. Senators said the cancellation of previously approved funding for food banks and other emergency food providers in every state will have a “significant and damaging impact upon millions of people.” A spokesperson told Reuters that USDA is still making purchases for food banks, but in interviews with food banks in seven states, Reuters learned that food banks already are seeing reduced deliveries of produce, meat, and other staples. The head of Mountaineer Food Bank in West Virginia told Reuters that 40% of the cheese, eggs, and milk they were expecting from TEFAP for April have been canceled. A Kern County, California, food bank that depended on TEFAP for about half the food it distributes has seen deliveries paused and will run out of supplies in two to six months. The funding cuts and freezes have halted a program in Illinois that helped local farmers provide food boxes to food pantries. About 32 truckloads of food for Feeding America West Michigan have been delayed or canceled by USDA, MLive reports . The Greater Cleveland Food Bank said it discovered on Tuesday that 553,000 pounds of food it was expecting have been canceled. “These are cuts to really effective programs that not only provide healthy food to people in need but also support farmers,” President and CEO Kristin Warzocha told Cleveland.com. “This is a terrible disappointment and is going to make our work significantly more difficult.” Farmers are reeling from the sudden loss of a vital market for their poultry, fruits, vegetables, and dairy. An Iowa farmer who sold about 20% of her pasture-raised turkeys and pork to food banks through LFPA told Reuters the cuts were “devastating.” Charlotte-based Nourish Up provided groceries to more than 164,000 families last year alone. With inflation making food more expensive, CEO Tina Postel said her organization is bracing themselves to face increasing demand for help with fewer resources. “Just last year, we fed more people than we ever had any year on record,” she told WBTV. Thirty percent of the food Nourish Up distributes comes from USDA. “So, to hear about cuts, we’re quite frankly terrified.” Related Resources USDA Cuts Hit Food Banks, Risking Hunger for Low-Income Americans Reuters Recent News More news Supreme Court Allows Stops Based on Race to Continue 09.17.25 Fort Hood, Texas 09.15.25 EJI Wins Reversals in Two Death Penalty Cases Updated 09.15.25 Fort Rucker, Alabama 09.10.25 More news",

The latest Household Food Security report released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service confirms FRAC’s ongoing warning: Without greater investments in anti-poverty and anti-hunger programs, hunger in this country will continue to climb. The report reveals that 47.4 million people lived in households experiencing food insecurity last year, an increase of 3.2 million compared to 2022, and 13.5 million compared to 2021. This spike was likely largely driven by inflation and the rollback of critical COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts that provided temporary boosts to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, allowed schools to offer school meals to all their students at no charge, and expanded the Child Tax Credit. Policymakers must return to and build on these proven interventions so that all households may thrive. Overall, the report reveals that about one in seven households (13.5 percent) in America struggled with hunger in 2023. The data also further illustrate how certain households are disproportionately at risk of having to choose between food and other basic necessities. 13.8 million children lived in households that experienced food insecurity, up 3.2 percent from 2022. 34.7 percent of single-parent households headed by women experienced food insecurity. Rates of food insecurity were higher for Black (23.3 percent) and Latinx (21.9 percent) households, both more than double the rate of White non-Latinx households (9.9 percent). Households in the Southern region continued to experience higher rates of food insecurity than any other U.S. region, with 14.7 percent of households experiencing food insecurity in 2023. A higher portion of households in urban areas (15.9 percent) and rural areas (15.4 percent) experienced food insecurity compared to suburbs (11.7 percent). 33.5 percent of households with reported incomes below 185 percent of the poverty threshold experienced food insecurity in 2023. Food insecurity in the United States would be even worse without federal nutrition programs and initiatives aimed at addressing poverty. SNAP is our nation’s first line of defense against hunger, but the benefit levels are too low. The 2021 adjustment to the Thrifty Food Plan, which is used to determine SNAP benefits, was an important step in increasing benefit levels, providing more resources to participants to purchase the food they need. Yet, despite an increase in food insecurity nationwide, rather than invest more in SNAP, several lawmakers seek to cut nearly $30 billion in SNAP benefits over 10 years by restricting future Thrifty Food Plan benefit adjustments. This is why FRAC and more than 1,400 national, state, and local organizations signed a letter urging Congress to strengthen SNAP benefits and protect SNAP from any cuts in the Farm Bill or any other legislative vehicles moving forward. Congress also should make free Healthy School Meals for All available to all students, reinstating the policy that was so successful during the pandemic and following in the footsteps of the eight states that have passed Healthy School Meals for All policies. In addition to investing in the proven federal nutrition programs, Congress must pass a permanent expanded and inclusive Child Tax Credit to create a more prosperous, nourished, and equitable nation. The country must also tackle the root causes and structural racism and other forms of discrimination that exacerbate hunger. By advancing policies that ensure fair wages, and improve access to affordable housing, health care, and disability benefits, our lawmakers can help break the cycle of poverty and hunger. We have the tools needed to end hunger. It’s time to wield them and finally make hunger in America a thing of the past. ### The Food Research & Action Center improves the nutrition, health, and well-being of people struggling against poverty-related hunger in the United States through advocacy, partnerships, and by advancing bold and equitable policy solutions.

      "extracted_content": "A new report from the United Nations reveals that 673 million people faced hunger in 2024, and 2.3 billion people—28% of the world’s population—were moderately or severely food insecure, despite signs of global progress. The report, The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2025, underscores the urgent need for bold action and greater investment to end hunger by 2030. Action Against Hunger, a leading global humanitarian organization, responded to the findings by calling on world leaders to prioritize food security and nutrition as part of a just and sustainable future. “Progress is possible—but it’s not guaranteed,” said Dr. Charles Owubah, CEO of Action Against Hunger. “The numbers are staggering. In an age of unprecedented wealth and technological advancement, more than 1 in 4 people still struggle to access enough food.” Key Findings from the 2025 Report: 673 million people were undernourished in 2024, a slight improvement from 2023 (695 million), but still far above pre-pandemic levels. 2.3 billion people were moderately or severely food insecure, including 545 million in low-income countries—a 17% increase since 2019. More than 1 billion people in Africa cannot afford a healthy diet, a sharp rise from 864 million in 2019. Food prices have surged, driving the average cost of a healthy diet to $4.46 per person per day (PPP)—up from $4.01 in 2022. The number of people unable to afford a healthy diet globally stands at 2.6 billion, or nearly 1 in 3 people worldwide. Hunger Disparities Worsen for Women, Rural Communities, and Children The report highlights persistent inequalities, with women and rural communities disproportionately affected. In 2024, food insecurity was higher among women in all regions, and rural areas faced significantly higher rates than urban areas. Child malnutrition remains widespread, with 23.2% of children under five affected by stunting and 6.6% by wasting. Alarmingly, child wasting has been linked to spikes in food prices, with a 10% increase in food costs leading to a 4–6% rise in severe wasting among children. The Price of Inaction With less than five years until the 2030 deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals, the report makes clear that the world is not on track to meet global hunger or nutrition targets. Without major investment and policy change, 512 million people are projected to remain hungry in 2030, with 60% of them living in Africa. “Hunger is rising sharply in Africa and remains dangerously high in fragile and conflict-affected regions,” said Owubah. “We must act now, not only to save lives but to transform systems so that everyone can access affordable, nutritious food—no matter where they live.” More On Inequity Together Against Hunger Action Against Hunger leads the global movement to end hunger.

      "extracted_content": "Back to All Home / News / MHA Releases 2024 State of Mental Health in America Report MHA Releases 2024 State of Mental Health in America Report Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maine rank highest; Nevada, Arizona, and Montana show greatest need for improvement ALEXANDRIA, Va. — Mental Health America (MHA) today released its annual State of Mental Health in America report, which ranks all 50 states and the District of Columbia based on 15 mental health access and prevalence measures. In this new report, using 2022 data, Massachusetts (1), Connecticut (2), and Maine (3) scored highest against a comprehensive range of well-being metrics. Meanwhile, Nevada (51), Arizona (50), and Montana (51) ranked the lowest. The report is based on federal data available for every state from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. To develop these rankings, MHA evaluated states on criteria such as the prevalence of mental health and substance use conditions, suicidal ideation, access to care, provider availability, and other metrics. The U.S. is indeed in a mental health crisis, according to MHA’s analysis. Nearly 60 million adults (23.08%) experienced a mental illness in the past year. Among other worrisome findings, nearly 13 million adults (5.04%) reported serious thoughts of suicide. The number of individuals who died by suicide in 2022 was the highest number ever recorded in the U.S., up after slight decreases in 2019 and 2020. The nation’s youth continue to present cause for concern. One in five young people from ages 12-17 experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, yet more than half of them (56.1%) did not receive any mental health treatment. More than 3.4 million youth (13.16%) had serious thoughts of suicide. More than 45 million adults (17.82%) and 2.3 million youth (8.95%) are experiencing a substance use disorder. “We are living in a time of polycrisis when evidence shows that the need for mental health care is urgent. High numbers of adults and youth alike are having serious thoughts of suicide, following a year with a record high number for completed suicides, substance use is on the rise, and other indicators of distress and disparity continue to escalate. And yet obstacles such as high costs or a shortage of mental health providers prevent so many Americans from accessing the help they need,” said Schroeder Stribling, president and CEO of MHA. “Mental Health America continues to advocate for policy and practice improvements that focus on upstream prevention and early intervention so that all people—as they deserve—have an opportunity to recover and flourish.” Barriers to obtaining mental health treatment persist nationwide. Nearly 6 million adults (10.1%) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared with 9.3% of adults without a mental illness. One in four (24.58%) adults who experienced 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were unable to see a doctor due to costs—a 2% increase over previous data. The shortage in mental health provider availability certainly doesn’t help. Data show there are 340 people for every one mental health provider. More than 122 million people live in a mental health workforce shortage area, with only 27% of the mental health care needs in shortage areas being met. “It is critical that we increase the affordability and availability of mental health care so people experiencing behavioral health conditions can access the care they want,” said Maddy Reinert, senior director of population health at MHA. “But that won’t fully address why people are experiencing distress in the first place. To reduce the negative impact of the mental health crisis, states must invest in a public health approach focused on prevention of mental distress and promotion of well-being.” MHA gathered the most recently available federal data in each state, with the majority collected through 2022. States with positive outcomes are ranked higher (closer to one) than states with poorer outcomes (closer to 51). The COVID-19 pandemic had a serious impact on federal agencies’ ability to collect national surveillance data in 2020. As a result, the rankings in this year’s State of Mental Health in America report cannot be compared to previous years, though it does provide an accurate snapshot of mental health at a point in time. In releasing the report, MHA aims to: inform policy and program planning, analysis, and evaluation; track changes in the prevalence of mental health issues and access to mental health care; and increase dialogue with and improve outcomes for individuals and families with mental health needs.

      "extracted_content": "New Study: Behavioral Health Workforce Shortage Will Negatively Impact Society Published: April 25, 2023 Share Burned-out mental health treatment and substance use care professionals call on lawmakers to act WASHINGTON, DC (April 25, 2023) — New survey data from the National Council for Mental Wellbeing, conducted by The Harris Poll, finds that the vast majority (83%) of the nation’s behavioral health workforce believes that without public policy changes, provider organizations won’t be able to meet the demand for mental health or substance use treatment and care. The survey, conducted among 750 behavioral health workers and more than 2,000 U.S. adults, also warns of a potential exodus of behavioral health workers due to burnout. “As we prepare to observe Mental Health Awareness Month, we urge policymakers to listen to the voices of those in the field,” National Council for Mental Wellbeing President and CEO Chuck Ingoglia said. “Behavioral health organizations are seeing an increase in the severity of cases, and a backlog of young people in need of care has led to more youth being seen in emergency departments. Taking steps now to bolster the workforce through increased recruitment and retention efforts and the continued expansion of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics will give organizations that provide mental health treatment and substance use care the resources they need to meet capacity.” View the Key Findings Infographic Download Shareable Social Media Graphics KEY FINDINGS The vast majority (83%) of the nation’s behavioral health workforce believes that without public policy changes, provider organizations won’t be able to meet the demand for mental health or substance use treatment and care. Around nine in 10 behavioral health workers are concerned about the ability for those not currently receiving care to gain access to care (90%) and the ability to provide care in the event of another health crisis in the future (87%). Nearly two in three (65%) reported increased client caseload, and more than seven in 10 (72%) reported increased client severity since the COVID-19 pandemic. More than nine in 10 behavioral health workers (93%) said they have experienced burnout, and a majority report suffering from moderate or severe levels of burnout (62%). Nearly half (48%) of behavioral health workers say the impacts of workforce shortages have caused them to consider other employment options. More than four in five behavioral health workers (83%) worry that workforce shortages in the mental health and substance use industry will negatively impact society as a whole. A third of the workforce reported spending most of their time on administrative tasks, with 68% of those who provide care to patients saying the amount of time spent on administrative tasks takes away from time they could be directly supporting clients. The National Council has identified numerous solutions to address workforce shortages in the field of mental health and substance use treatment and care, including: 1. Create a Behavioral Health Workforce Demonstration Creation of a Behavioral Health Workforce Demonstration to help recruit and retain mental health and substance use treatment staff at critical safety net provider organizations. Given the high turnover and burnout rates, funding options to support retention bonuses, hazard pay, overtime and more could significantly support the retention and wellbeing of behavioral health workers. 2. Increase funding and expand national loan repayment programs Increased funding for and expansion of national loan repayment programs, including the National Health Service Corps (NHSC), the NHSC Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Program (LRP) and the Substance Use Disorder Treatment and Recovery (STAR) LRP, to include those who provide care outside clinic walls and increased access to tuition assistance for the mental health and substance use fields similar to the Nurse Corps Scholarship Program . Currently, no such equivalent exists for the behavioral health workforce. 3. Further support the implementation and financing of CCBHCs Further support the implementation and financing of Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHCs) to ensure access to services nationwide. The CCBHC model transforms the traditional reimbursement rate model by allowing clinics to include the actual costs of expanding access to care in their reimbursement rate, including measuring appropriate staffing and service needs unique to their community, plus potential salary and benefits changes. With the help of this innovation, clinics that became CCBHCs hired an average of 27 new positions per clinic and experienced an average 16% increase in their workforce. 4. Support Mental Health Access Improvement Act implementation Support implementation of the Mental Health Access Improvement Act, legislation that was supported by the National Council and passed into law in late 2022. This legislation would allow marriage and family therapists and licensed professional counselors to bill Medicare and provide support for this sector of the workforce as they prepare for new billing structures and more. 5. Work to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens Work with the administration to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens that contribute to burnout. The research found a third of the workforce reported spending most of their time on administrative tasks, with 68% of those who provide care to patients saying the amount of time spent on administrative tasks takes away from time they could be directly supporting clients. DETAILED FINDINGS Despite challenges created by the workforce shortage, a majority of those in the behavioral health field remain passionate about and fulfilled by their work. Nearly all employees are satisfied with their ability to make a difference for their clients (96%) and to help others at their current job (95%). However, workers say they face significant new challenges: Four in five (82%) say their passion for working in the industry is unwavering. Administrative tasks take away from time they could be directly supporting clients (68% of those who see clients and have administrative tasks). Their waitlist is longer than ever (58% of those who provide care to clients). They are seeing more than their ideal number of clients on a weekly basis (31% of those who provide care to clients). More than nine in 10 behavioral health workers (93%) said they have experienced burnout, and a majority report suffering from moderate or severe levels of burnout (62% reporting their level of burnout is an 8, 9 or 10 on a scale from 1 to 10 where 1 is no burnout at all and 10 is significantly burned out). Their work has had some negative impact on their life (80%), including their own mental health (37%). The impacts of workforce shortages have caused them to consider other employment options (48%). The shortage shows no sign of easing. By 2025, the U.S. will be short about 31,000 full-time equivalent mental health practitioners, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Behavioral health workers and the general public worry that the workforce shortage will negatively impact society. This comes at a time when access to care remains challenging and the number and severity of mental health and substance use cases has increased, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. The nation’s behavioral health workforce says a shortage of workers in the substance use and mental health field harms their ability to provide care and has made it more difficult for people to receive treatment, and large majorities of behavioral health workers and the general public worry about the impact of the workforce shortage on the health of the public: COVID-19 has led to increases in client severity (72%) and caseload (65%) among those who provide care to clients. More than four in five behavioral health workers (83%) and three-quarters o",

They hold training sessions on using them and help people in recovery from drug and alcohol addiction return to their jobs and families. They work closely with the federal government through an agency that monitors their productivity, connects them with other like-minded groups and dispenses critical funds that keep their work going. But over the last few weeks, Ms. Wright’s phone calls and emails to Washington have gone unanswered. Federal advisers from the agency’s local office — who supervise her group, the Chicago Recovering Communities Coalition , as well as addiction programs throughout six Midwestern states and 34 tribes — are gone. “We just continue to do the work without any updates from the feds at all,” Ms. Wright said. “But we’re lost.” By the end of this week, the staff of the agency, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , could be cut by 50 percent, according to senior staff members at the agency and congressional aides who attended briefings by Trump officials.

      "extracted_content": "Protesters criticize health agency cuts Protesters criticize health agency cuts in latest move to shrink size of federal government 02:11 When the Trump administration cut more than $11 billion in COVID-era funds to states in late March, addiction recovery programs suffered swift losses. An Indiana organization that employs people in recovery to help peers with substance use disorders and mental illness was forced to lay off three workers. A Texas digital support service for people with addiction and mental illness prepared to shutter its 24/7 call line within a week. A Minnesota program focused on addiction in the East African community curtailed its outreach to vulnerable people on the street. Although the federal assistance was awarded during the COVID-19 pandemic and some of the funds supported activities related to infectious disease, a sizable chunk went to programs on mental health and addiction. The latter are both chronic concerns in the U.S. that were exacerbated during the pandemic and continue to affect millions of Americans . Colorado, for example, received more than $30 million for such programs and Minnesota received nearly $28 million, according to health and human services agencies in those states. In many cases, this money flowed to addiction recovery services, which go beyond traditional treatment to help people with substance use disorders rebuild their lives. These programs do things that insurers often don't reimburse, such as driving people to medical appointments and court hearings, crafting résumés and training them for new jobs, finding them housing, and helping them build social connections unrelated to drugs. A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's cuts, allowing the programs to continue — for now — receiving federal funding. But many of the affected programs say they can't easily rehire people they laid off or resurrect services they curtailed. And they're unsure they can survive long-term amid an environment of uncertainty and fear, not knowing when the judge's ruling might be lifted or another funding source cut. The week it slashed the funding, the Trump administration also announced a massive reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services , including the consolidation of the main federal agency focused on addiction recovery services. Without a stand-alone office like the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, many advocates worry , recovery work — and the funding to support it — will no longer be a priority. Although private foundations and state governments may step in, it's unlikely they could match the tranches of federal funding. \"Recovery support is treated as optional,\" said Racquel Garcia , founder of HardBeauty, a Colorado-based addiction recovery organization. The federal cuts put at risk a roughly $75,000 grant her team had received to care for pregnant women with substance use disorders in two rural counties in Colorado. \"It's very easy to make sweeping decisions from the top in the name of money, when you don't have to be the one to tell the mom, 'We can't show up today,'\" Garcia said. \"When you never have to sit in front of the mama who really needed us to be there.\" Mental health conditions, including substance use disorders, are a leading cause of maternal mortality in the U.S. And although national overdose deaths have decreased recently , rates have risen in many Black and Native American communities . Many people in the addiction field worry these funding rollbacks could reverse hard-earned progress. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard told KFF Health News that the department is reorganizing to improve efficiency, foster a more coordinated approach to addiction, and prioritize funding projects that align with the president's Make America Healthy Again initiative. \"We aim to streamline resources and eliminate redundancies, ensuring that essential mental health and substance use disorder services are delivered more effectively,\" she said in a statement. But to Garcia, it doesn't feel like streamlining. It feels like abandoning moms in need. Between the time the cuts were announced and when the federal judge paused them, two women served by Garcia's program gave birth, she said. Though her grant funding was in limbo, Garcia told her employee to show up at the bedside for both moms. The employee followed up with daily check-ins for the new moms, connected them to treatment or housing services when needed, and helped them navigate the child services system. \"I just can't leave moms\" without services, Garcia said. \"I just can't do it.\" Nor can she abandon that employee, she said. Although the federal funding provided half of that employee's salary, Garcia has continued to keep her on full time. Garcia said she primarily employs women in recovery, many of whom spent years trapped in abusive situations, relying on welfare benefits. Now they're sober and have found meaningful work that allows them to provide for their families, she said. \"We created our own workforce of mamas who help other mamas.\" This type of recovery workforce development seems to align with the Republican Party's goals of getting more people to work and reducing reliance on welfare benefits. The Trump administration's drug policy priorities, released in early April , identified creating \"a skilled, recovery-ready workforce\" and strengthening peer recovery support services as crucial efforts to help people \"find recovery and lead productive, healthy lives.\" Many recovery programs train people for blue-collar jobs, which could support President Trump's goal of reviving the manufacturing industry. But the administration's actions appear to conflict with its stated goals, said Rahul Gupta , the nation's drug czar during the Biden administration. \"You can't have manufacturing if people can't pass a urine drug test or continue to suffer from addiction or relapse,\" said Gupta, who is now president of GATC Health, a company using artificial intelligence for drug development. Even if jobs return to rural America, cutting funding for recovery services and the main federal office overseeing such efforts could mean fewer people are employable, Gupta said. Research on recovery programs, particularly those run by people with personal addiction experience, suggests they can increase engagement in court-ordered treatment , reduce the prevalence of rearrest, bolster attendance at treatment appointments , and improve the likelihood of families reunifying and stabilizing . Billy O'Bryan sees these benefits daily. As a state director for the national nonprofit Young People in Recovery , O'Bryan oversees about a dozen chapters in Kentucky that teach people in recovery life skills, such as balancing a checkbook and interviewing for jobs, and show them how to have fun in sobriety, through group hikes and glow-in-the-dark Ultimate Frisbee games. Providing recovery services \"is when we really invest in their future,\" said O'Bryan, who is in recovery too. Young People in Recovery is a national nonprofit focused on addiction recovery. Billy O'Bryan Six of his chapters were affected by the federal funding cuts. That has meant dipping into his organization's rainy day fund to pay staff and cutting back on community events, including clean-up days in which chapter members gather used syringes off the street, pass out the overdose reversal medication naloxone, and talk to people using drugs about the possibility of recovery. He's exploring fundraising efforts now, but not all his chapters have the same ability. \"In a city like Louisville, fundraising is not a problem,\" O'Bryan said, \"but when you get out into Grayson, Kentucky\" — a rural area in the Appalachian Mountains — \"there's not a lot of opportunities.\" In Minnesota, Kaleab Woldegiorgis and his colleagues at Niyyah Recovery Initiative used to spend hours a day at soup kitchens, community events, mosques, and on the s",

      "extracted_content": "Newsroom Journalist on Deadline? In This Section Press Release Street medicine filling a major gap by providing behavioral health care for people who are homeless While they are more at risk for mental health and substance use disorders, unhoused people in California face barriers to accessing treatment. Hope Hamashige September 05, 2023 Brett Feldman, Eddie Menacho and Gabrielle Johnson work as part of the Street Medicine team at USC, which provides medical care to people who are living on the streets. (Photo/Chris Shinn) Mental health and substance use disorders are prevalent among people experiencing homelessness, yet access to care for these health issues is challenging for people living on the streets. Now, a new survey conducted by a team of researchers from USC Street Medicine found that, in California, street medicine programs are helping to fill this gap, delivering critical, high-level mental health and substance use treatments to the state’s unsheltered population. The survey, published in Community Mental Health Journal , shows that street medicine has the potential to serve as the basis for a strategy to expand access to behavioral health care for the people who are unhoused. “This survey showed that there is tremendous need for mental health and substance use services and that street medicine programs are providing more services and higher-level care out of necessity,” said Brett Feldman, director and co-founder of USC Street Medicine, assistant professor of family medicine at Keck School of Medicine of USC , and one of the authors of the study. “We found that street medicine teams have trained up to provide a higher level of behavioral health care because there’s little access to psychiatric care, especially on the street.” The authors noted that addressing the mental health and substance use problems, common among the state’s homeless population, is one key to improving communities’ efforts to address homelessness. Need is great, resources are sparse The researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC surveyed 29 street medicine teams in California, 26 of which completed the survey. One was excluded because it is too new a program to have meaningful data. Street medicine organizations reported that 64% of their patients have mental health problems and 67% have substance use disorders. All but one of the street medicine programs provides some mental health and treatment for substance use disorders. Despite the need, most of the street medicine programs reported having difficulty successfully referring their patients to mental health and addiction treatment programs. Referring unhoused patients to specialists is often difficult, noted Feldman, since many have no address, phone number or transportation to make visits to specialists. Eight of the street medicine programs surveyed include a psychiatrist, but only two of them are full-time. Six of the teams have part-time psychiatrists who provide between four to 10 hours a week of care. Feldman added that there is a national shortage of psychiatrists, which has made it increasingly difficult for disadvantaged people, such as people living on the streets, to access psychiatric services. Street medicine programs are typically staffed with primary care providers who are trained to treat some mental health issues, but people with complex or severe mental health problems often need the type of care that only a psychiatrist can provide. Addressing the problem of access The study concludes that street medicine is a promising approach to improving access to mental health and substance use care for people who are unsheltered. Feldman said 60% of the state’s programs provide very high-level care, such as medication-assisted therapy, which involves treating substance use disorders with medications, such as suboxone, in combination with counseling and behavioral therapy. Street medicine providers have also embraced using long-acting antipsychotics for people with severe mental illness. These drugs last up to about a month, which makes adherence simpler for people living on the street and stabilizes them for longer periods of time than daily oral medications. The study’s authors also suggest novel approaches to providing behavioral health services should be explored, such as using telehealth during street visits to provide patients with access to psychiatric care or treatment for addiction. They also assert that additional research should be done to understand the barriers that exist to providing medications to treat psychiatric problems and substance use disorders and find new ways to improve access. Finally, the authors conclude that the all of the strategies for providing behavioral health care through street medicine should be further studied and evaluated to allow for the development of evidence-based practices that can be tested, replicated, reimbursed and operationalized.

      "extracted_content": "CHICAGO — As part of its commitment to eliminating inequities and improving access to care for historically marginalized communities across the nation, the American Medical Association (AMA) today bolstered policy aimed at addressing the health needs of rural populations—enhancing access to care through educational strategies for rural physician workforce expansion. Research shows that rural communities experience significant health inequities due to structural factors, such as limited access to primary and specialty physician care. While the current supply of rural physicians has not yet matched the demand for care, investments to increase medical students’ commitment and exposure to rural medicine can help meet this need. Membership Moves Medicine™ Thousands of free CME opportunities to fulfill state requirements A powerful voice fighting for you during uncertain times Research, resources, events and more from the largest physician organization Join the AMA Today “For the nearly 60 million people who live in rural communities across America, persistent inequities continue to place barriers on access to medical care—resulting in devastatingly higher rates of mortality and preventable hospitalizations for this patient population,” said AMA Board of Trustees Member Scott Ferguson, M.D. “There is a clear, urgent need for more physicians to serve in rural America to help close existing gaps in patient care. The AMA is dedicated to addressing the root causes of health inequities for the rural patient population, and this policy is one step closer to removing those obstacles to care and achieving optimal health for all.” The updated policy focuses on multifaceted educational strategies to help strengthen the rural physician workforce, recommending measures to encourage the pursuit of and exposure to rural training opportunities that reach patients in the greatest need of access to care. Under the expanded policy, the AMA will continue to support long-term solutions to address this critical issue, including: Encouraging Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) review committees to consider adding exposure to rural medicine as appropriate, encourage the development of rural program tracks in training programs, and increase physician awareness of the conditions that pose challenges and lack of resources in rural areas Supporting the use of additional virtual educational content to help enhance smaller training programs Monitoring the 2020 U.S. Census report to assess the impact of physician supply and patient demand in rural communities Working to augment the impact of initiatives to address rural physician workforce shortages Undertaking a study of structural urbanism, federal payment policies, and the impact on rural workforce disparities An AMA Council on Medical Education report associated with the policy also acknowledges diverse recruitment efforts explicitly targeting students from rural areas and efforts to decrease rural hospital closures as additional interventions to help improve rural health outcomes. Along with numerous existing policies on the topic of rural health, the AMA continues work to analyze the changing physician workforce landscape and identify ways to expand career pathways for physicians to practice in rural settings. Since 2013, the AMA’s Accelerating Change in Medical Consortium has engaged medical schools across the country to help improve care specific to the needs of rural and remote communities. In addition, the 2021 Medical Justice in Advocacy Fellowship created by the AMA and the Satcher Health Leadership Institute at the Morehouse School of Medicine empowers physician-led advocacy efforts to advance health equity and improve the health and wellbeing of historically marginalized patients and communities.

      "extracted_content": "Impact of housing affordability on communities Public officials around the country are deeply concerned about the price of housing and the ability of residents to afford living in their cities, towns and states. They know what a profound effect the issue of housing affordability can have on the life of the communities they lead. “This is the biggest crisis in housing since the Great Depression. And it’s not a New York/San Francisco crisis — this crisis is across the United States, including rural areas,” says former Trammell Crow Co. national managing partner J. Ronald Terwilliger. Focusing on affordability should be among any community’s top priorities, says Kevin Faulconer, former mayor of San Diego. “We need to think about homes the way we think about water and streets. These aren’t nice to have — they’re essentials. Economic benefits Having an ample supply of affordable places to live fosters a host of economic benefits for communities and also serves to heighten civic participation, increase public safety and create a greater sense of community pride “We need to think about homes the way we think about water and streets. These aren’t nice to have — they’re essentials.” — Kevin Faulconer, former San Diego mayor “We can’t allow people to be priced out. If our city becomes too expensive for people to live, we’re not going to be able to provide a future for our kids and our grandkids,” Faulconer says. “We also need to ensure that police officers, firefighters, teachers and nurses who work and serve in our city can afford to actually live in our city.” The economic impact of housing affordability can start a ripple effect for an entire community. When families spend less on housing, they have more to spend on goods and services. These transactions fuel community-wide economic growth by bolstering local businesses and the local workforce. They also contribute to the local tax base that gets invested back into the community through government programs and infrastructure improvements — resources that benefit everyone. Communities depend on workers at varying levels from varying industries. “Economic diversity is really important for a neighborhood to succeed,” says Majora Carter, an urban revitalization strategy consultant. “People want neighborhoods where they can get their creature comforts and needs taken care of — whether that’s at the barbershop or the cleaners or a bookstore or a restaurant.” But to keep people working in these positions, to keep businesses open and the neighborhood humming, affordable housing options based on income levels must be made available, she explains. “Vibrant communities have lots of different types of people in them,” says Carter. “But if we don’t secure affordability for some, that vibrancy can fade very quickly.” A connection to community Part of this vibrancy is the way that neighbors support one another — a characteristic more likely found in communities where housing is stable and affordable, says Tiffany Manuel, an affordable housing expert and president and CEO of TheCaseMade. “When I think about myself — because I know I’m going to live in my particular community for a while — I show up in community differently,” she says. “I meet my neighbors differently. I’m willing to do the work of putting in time and energy into the relationships with my neighbors and with organizations in my community because I feel part of it. I belong.” Renters and homeowners alike who have that connection with their neighbors and their surroundings tend to invest in and care for their community more deeply, says Manuel. “This is the place that you come home to at night. It’s the environment that shapes you and your children,” she says. As a result, residents are more likely to work to ensure that environment is a safe and productive one. Homes that are affordable allow families to put a stake in their community, improving the space for everyone living there. Strong neighborhoods exist where residents have quality housing; are invested and engaged in their communities; have access to transportation, employment and educational opportunities and have a sense of safety and inclusion.

      "extracted_content": "Housing: The Affordability Challenge in a Growing Region This comprehensive report, funded through a grant from the Lilly Endowment to the Community Foundation of Southern Indiana (CFSI), was developed in partnership with the Applied Research and Education Center (AREC) at Indiana University Southeast. The availability of affordable housing is a growing challenge across Clark and Floyd counties. Our recent study, Housing: The Affordability Challenge in a Growing Region , examines the structural dynamics of income and the housing market in our growing region, offering key insights into the challenges faced by local residents. Understanding the Housing Crisis The study dives into the structural dynamics of income and the housing market in our Southern Indiana region. Its primary goal is to uncover leverage points for systemic change, ensuring better housing outcomes for the significant portion of Clark and Floyd County residents burdened by housing costs. Alarmingly, the findings reveal that rising housing costs are far outpacing income growth, especially for lower-income households. This imbalance disproportionately affects Black, Hispanic/Latine, and female-headed single-parent households, exacerbating housing insecurity and perpetuating long-term inequalities. Key Findings from the Report Housing Cost Burden: A third of Clark and Floyd County households have incomes below $50,000. Those earning less than $50,000 per year are most likely to struggle with high housing cost burden. Housing that is affordable to these households is in short supply and market forces alone are not likely to increase supply at this price point. Renters at Risk: Approximately 52% of Clark County and 42% of Floyd County renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. Rising Homeownership Costs : Among owners, 20.5% in Clark County and 15.3% in Floyd County spend 30% or more of their income on housing costs. This burden leaves households that simply can’t afford regular updates and necessary maintenance on their properties. Barriers to Homeownership: Low vacancy rates, gentrification and the rise of short-term rentals, and growth in new workforce and high-end housing are pricing residents out, making it difficult for adults earning at or below Area Median Income (AMI) to enter homeownership, leaving vulnerable residents one “life event” away from being unhoused. Leveraging the Community Needs Assessment According to the 2020 Assessment of Needs and Priorities in Clark and Floyd counties, known as the Priorities for Progress: Assets and Aspirations in Southern Indiana 2021 , affordable housing is a top priority for residents in the region. While the local housing market has rebounded from the 2008 collapse, the rental market, places safe, quality housing out of reach for many workers. In 2019, an estimated 50.6% of the two-county region’s renter households spent 30% or more of monthly household income on rent (not including utilities). Nearly 7,000 Clark and Floyd County households spent 50% or more of monthly earnings on housing (not including utilities) during the 2014-2018 period. The Needs Assessment argues for more mixed income housing development, which would ease the price pressures on the local rental market and increase access to affordable housing for low-wage workers. The Road Ahead The study outlines innovative strategies used across the U.S., such as community land trusts and mixed-income housing developments, that could be adapted to Southern Indiana. It calls for local governments, nonprofits, developers, and financial institutions to work together to create sustainable solutions that prioritize equity and affordability. The report also stresses the importance of collective action. It urges stakeholders to align resources and implement policies that prioritize housing affordability and equity. Without intervention, rising housing costs could continue to displace vulnerable populations and hinder economic growth. Next Steps for Southern Indiana The Housing: The Affordability Challenge in a Growing Region report is a vital resource for understanding and addressing housing challenges in Clark and Floyd counties. By fostering collaboration and embracing innovative solutions, our region can leverage its resources – including land, funding, policy tools, and grant opportunities – to develop sustainable affordable housing models.

      "extracted_content": "Transportation barriers shape all aspects of life in underserved communities April 9, 2024 Transportation systems are often seen as a physical infrastructure of roads, bridges, bus routes, and sidewalks. Dig a little deeper, and it’s clear that transportation systems are also a series of decisions made by institutions with power—a reflection of societal power structures. This deeper truth takes a toll on communities that do not reflect the dominant identity within a society; their ability (or lack of ability) to move throughout a city or town to complete everyday tasks highlights the way transportation decisions have often been made without them in mind. In a recent study, U of M researchers aimed to center the experiences of these marginalized communities and better understand inequities in the current transportation system. “For underserved communities, their lived experience shows that transportation is essential to all aspects of their lives including work, family, health, community, and spirituality,” says Yingling Fan , a professor with the U of M’s Humphrey School of Public Affairs . “Good transportation means much more to them than infrastructure quality and maintenance: It means a dignified life, a place to call home, a living-wage job, and essential connections with family and friends.” The preliminary findings from this project, which is part of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) Advancing Transportation Equity initiative , were presented at the Our Transportation, Our Lives event on May 1, 2023, in Minneapolis and covered in Catalyst ’s June 2023 issue . At the event, researchers shared qualitative findings from six of the underserved community groups represented in the study: Black, Hmong, single mothers, immigrants, people living with HIV, and Native Americans. The final report expands on the preliminary presentation in two important ways. First, it presents qualitative findings from four additional community groups: Latinx, people with disabilities, rural residents (specifically in Fergus Falls, Minnesota), and single fathers. “The one-on-one interviews collected open-ended answers regarding the systemic transportation-related barriers facing underserved communities, as well as the coping and survival strategies participants use to navigate these barriers,” Fan says. Transportation-related barriers can limit access to health care. Second, the report adds texture to the qualitative data from the interviews with quantitative data from travel behavior surveys. Using a smartphone-based diary app , the research team collected data from more than 100 participants between November 2022 and February 2023. The app recorded data for a week’s worth of travel and prompted users to add their perceptions, attitudes, and feelings toward transportation in the context of daily living. Based on this wealth of data, researchers recommended actions for addressing the unique transportation barriers for each of the 10 communities in the study. They also identified three common threads among all 10 groups: car-related challenges, inadequate public transportation, and the impact of transportation on major life outcomes. “While each community had unique transportation challenges, the common themes across communities were profound,” Fan says. In communities across Minnesota, a car was seen as a necessary method of transportation but also a significant challenge to purchase and maintain. Public transportation served an important role but was also inadequate in meeting participants’ needs. “Ultimately,” Fan says, “participants highlighted the many ways in which inadequate transportation kept them from flourishing.” The first step to address these challenges, Fan says, is to identify the communities whose transportation barriers have hampered their ability to live a good life—and then align transportation funding and investments to those underserved communities. Additional recommendations include: Reconceptualize public transportation as any mobility service that de-commodifies transportation and helps people to achieve a socially acceptable standard of mobility and accessibility independent of their income. Encourage transformative innovations to broaden the scope of traditional public transportation services to include ride-hailing and micro-transit services. Collaborate with non-transportation government agencies and community organizations to pair transportation programs with non-transportation programs. Promote more diverse public engagement in transportation decision-making processes through active involvement of underserved communities and efforts to study the lived experiences of these communities. Moving forward, MnDOT will use the findings to support its Advancing Transportation Equity Initiative and community engagement efforts. “This research illustrates the importance of talking directly to community members to understand their transportation needs,” says Lisa Austin, director of MnDOT’s Center for Community Connections and the project’s technical liaison. “We learned where people couldn’t go because they didn’t have a way to get there.” —Megan Tsai, contributing writer More Information Research project page Research report Personal stories illustrate transportation inequities in Minnesota, CTS Catalyst, June 2023 Stories on Related Topics Beyond traffic: Transportation as a social construct Making sense of J-turns: Could better signage make them more likable?

      "extracted_description": "People with limited access to reliable transportation also have limited access to jobs, resources, and most other basic necessities.",
      "extracted_content": "Transportation plays a crucial, yet often unexamined, role in daily life. Those who have consistent access to a private vehicle or high-quality public transit can reach a relatively large geographical radius of employers, schools, healthcare centers, stores, pharmacies, and other essential resources. Those who don’t, however, can find themselves cut off from many of these amenities, which can hamper their ability to thrive. Individuals and families who are Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed (ALICE) face a wide array of barriers that render them unable to reliably access transportation . These can effectively block their path to financial stability and a good quality of life. Here’s what you need to know about constraints on transportation for low-income families and how these challenges perpetuate financial struggles for ALICE households. Types of Transportation Barriers for ALICE Households Racial and Gender Wealth Gaps Racial and gender pay gaps stemming from historic and current inequalities continue in the present, resulting in significant unjust wealth gaps. For example, women and people of color are more likely to experience bias and exclusion during job application and hiring processes as well as pay gaps and barriers to promotion. Single mothers are often limited to part-time jobs because of their caregiving responsibilities. Both women and people of color also experience occupational segregation into low-paying and caregiving-related industries. Further, generational poverty and limited financial resources—including low levels of financial literacy and related credit challenges—can make it even more difficult for people of color to afford reliable transportation of all kinds, public or private. Difficulty Affording Personal Vehicles For ALICE individuals, purchasing a personal vehicle can be a significant financial burden. First, there’s the steep cost of a vehicle itself, which can skyrocket during periods of inflation or low supply. Then there are numerous recurring costs related to things like car insurance, state license plate and tag renewals, maintenance, repairs, fuel, freeway tolls, rental housing parking fees, and more. Without an owned vehicle, individuals and families often become dependent on public transportation or carpooling, which are typically more affordable options than frequent taxi or rideshare services. This directly affects individuals’ and families’ ranges of mobility in a given metro area. As a result, ALICE groups experience greater difficulty in reaching not only essential community resources–e.g. full-service grocery stores and medical centers–but high-quality employment as well. People who are ALICE are often then limited to jobs within their immediate vicinity, which, in underinvested low-income communities, are more likely to be low-paying. Inadequate Public Transportation in Low-Income Areas Members of many racial and ethnic communities grapple with problems related to a lack of public transportation in greater numbers than their White counterparts, and they are also more likely to fall in ALICE groups. Communities of color are more likely to live in underinvested neighborhoods with inadequate transportation infrastructure, which can severely limit their mobility. African American and Hispanic populations face longer travel times due to limited bus and subway timetables, route or line changes, and geographic segregation. All of this leads to increased commuting costs and time constraints, making it challenging for low-income households to balance work and family obligations while pursuing financial stability. Non-Traditional Work Schedules ALICE groups are more likely to have non-traditional work schedules, such as evening, night, or weekend shifts. Public transportation options may be scarce or nonexistent during off-peak hours, making it difficult for these individuals to commute to and from work. Relying on alternative modes of transportation, such as taxis or rideshare services, can be cost-prohibitive on limited incomes. In other words, the very people who often rely most heavily on public transit aren’t being adequately served by its hours and modes of operation. Transportation barriers pose significant challenges for ALICE individuals and families, hindering their path to financial success. The intersectionality of race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status further exacerbates these constraints. By understanding and addressing these barriers, policymakers and communities can work towards creating transportation equity and facilitating the financial stability of ALICE individuals. By dismantling transportation barriers, we can empower ALICE individuals to access better job opportunities, improve their earning potential, and ultimately achieve financial stability. Creating an inclusive transportation system that caters to the needs of all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic background, is a vital step towards building more equitable and prosperous communities.

      "extracted_content": "Empowering Tomorrow’s Workforce Today: Tackling Skill Gaps with Work-Based Learning As the skills gap grows, employers face significant challenges in finding qualified candidates to fill critical roles. At the same time, students struggle to connect classroom learning with the demands of real-world careers. Bridging this gap requires innovative solutions that align education with workforce needs. Education at Work is at the forefront of this effort, partnering with organizations to prepare the next generation of talent through meaningful work-based learning opportunities. The workforce of tomorrow hinges on our actions today. This blog explores the pressing challenges of learning loss, the demand for skills-based hiring, and how partnerships with organizations like Education at Work can empower students and employers to secure a future-ready workforce. Learning Loss and the Future Talent Pipeline Learning loss remains a pressing issue, with students struggling to regain ground after disruptions in education. Despite a return to the classroom, many students increasingly rely on technology and AI shortcuts, limiting their active engagement with learning tasks. This reliance often prevents them from developing essential soft skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication—qualities that are vital for career success. The current public school system is not designed to address these challenges effectively, leaving a significant portion of future talent ill-equipped to meet the demands of the workforce. Skills-Based Hiring Challenges in the Workforce Whether emerging talent is adequately prepared to enter the workforce has become a shared concern for businesses and society. According to SHRM’s 2024 Talent Trends report , 75% of organizations struggled to fill full-time positions last year, with over 8.7 million job openings across the U.S. Many of these hiring challenges stem from technical and soft skills gaps. Technical Skill Shortages: Skilled trade positions were the second most difficult to fill in 2023, with 46% of HR professionals reporting significant challenges in recruiting for these roles. Over one-third of HR professionals cite a lack of candidates with the right technical skills as a primary barrier to recruitment. Soft Skill Gaps: As AI and automation reshape industries, critical thinking has become a top priority for employers. 77% of HR professionals identify it as a key skill for emerging professionals. However, less than one-third of employers believe recent graduates possess the critical thinking skills necessary to succeed. These skill gaps highlight the urgent need for innovative approaches to workforce readiness. Addressing Workforce Readiness Through Work-Based Learning Work-based learning programs offer solutions by forging partnerships between employers, educational institutions, and students. These programs equip students with the technical and soft skills necessary for career success while helping employers build a reliable talent pipeline.

Workforce development programs — funded through public-private partnerships — appear to bridge the skills gap by helping companies to scale and expanding opportunities for less skilled workers, according to recent research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. After training, organizations had longer employment growth and down-skilling in job posts, as compared to a matched control group, the researchers found. They looked at 18 states with grant subsidies for training. “The evidence we present suggests these grants resolve a skills gap which previously prevented firms from operating at optimal scale,” the researchers wrote. “The fact that labor inputs change post grant receipt means that these grants are not purely crowding out private sector funds.” Typically, the researchers wrote, these workforce development programs operate with explicit goals of upskilling the state’s workforce, especially in transferable skills that could apply across employers. In practice, the grants are more likely to be used in competitive labor markets, particularly based on the concentration of hiring firms or market tightness. In addition, the grants seem to be disproportionately allocated to larger and higher-paying firms and labor markets, as well as companies seeking to hire more skilled workers, the researchers found. Grants aren’t typically used to even out prospects across neighboring markets or target emerging markets, they wrote. After receiving a training grant, companies tended to experience higher employment levels and reduce education and work experience requirements, the researchers found. Grants appeared to help companies shift to a long-term higher growth trajectory, potentially resolving specific skill shortages that blocked growth or training investments, they wrote. Notably, most organizations’ training plans targeted professional skills, such as leadership and process management, which opened up recruitment for lower skilled roles post-training. This could mean that firms needed managerial skills to accomplish institutional change, and once achieved, they could focus on productivity growth through low-wage expansion, the researchers wrote. Beyond that, training focused on production-related skills, particularly pivoting employees to work with automation technology. In these cases, training likely helped with worker retention or avoided layoffs, the researchers wrote. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Talent, Learning",

Peña-Mora speaks at the ASCE Solutions Summit March 25. The world woke up Tuesday morning to find civil engineers dominating the news cycle. The topic topping everyone’s feeds? Infrastructure. ASCE released its 2025 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure March 25 with a Solutions Summit event in Washington, D.C. The cumulative grade point average for America’s infrastructure was a C, the highest mark since ASCE started releasing report cards in 1998. And the news traveled fast. New York Times . CNN . CBS News . Associated Press . Politico . Each published prominent content pieces early Tuesday morning, highlighting the infrastructure report card for a mass audience. “I think it's so important,” said Darren Olson, chair of the Committee on America’s Infrastructure, which develops the report card. “The message that we have resonates with everybody. It resonates with our elected officials, it resonates with business owners, it resonates with American families. When we invest in infrastructure, it helps all of us. “And to see that message go out across such large platforms, it’s so rewarding, knowing what that kind of communication will do.” ASCE publishes the report every four years, assigning grades to U.S. infrastructure overall and 18 individual infrastructure sectors. The 2021 report card graded America’s infrastructure with a C-. “We have seen the difference investment can make in improving infrastructure,” said 2025 President Feniosky A. Peña-Mora. “And while this grade showcases that investment leads to direct results, the job is not yet done. As the report card makes clear, there is still a great need for sustained investments. Delaying upgrades to our nation’s roads, bridges, transit, and utilities will cost families and businesses time and money, in addition to creating unsafe yet often avoidable situations.” Of course, driving the conversation around infrastructure investment is an essential first step, but it is only the first step. Finding solutions that will improve upon America’s infrastructure C grade is the continued mission of the ASCE advocacy efforts – hence Tuesday’s Solutions Summit. The summit convened leaders from around the infrastructure space – civil engineers, elected officials, executives, and financial advisers, among others. The panel discussions and talks ranged from future innovations to specific sector needs. “Public works stuff tends to be very bipartisan,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, at the Solutions Summit. “And (Committee Chair) Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and I are discussing how to make progress with both water and highway bills that we have coming up to expand on the progress that your report card has indicated. I’m eager to do that. We clearly need more investment in infrastructure. You kind of can’t go wrong with that. And to do it in a bipartisan fashion is the right way to go.” The summit looked more deeply into some of the challenges that must be addressed to improve infrastructure. Rep. Sam Graves (Missouri), chair of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, spoke at the summit and pointed at the need to eliminate red tape. “Permit reform – we absolutely have to have it,” Graves said. “And the appetite is there in both the House and the Senate, on both sides of the aisle. One of the things we’re seeing with the IIJA (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) is it’s taking forever to move a lot of that money that is sitting out there for a lot of these projects. … There’s going to be a huge permitting reform push to streamline those projects.” Ultimately, ASCE’s overarching advocating concern is sustained investment. The report card and last year’s ASCE Bridging the Gap study find a $3.7 trillion investment gap for America’s infrastructure if current funding levels continue. “It’s important to continue to invest because that investment actually brings prosperity to the United States,” Peña-Mora said. “It brings manufacturing, it brings jobs back home. It supports our safety and security. “And that investment supports our communities.” Infrastructure Policy & Planning Advocacy & Government Relations Infrastructure Assessment Report Card for America's Infrastructure Society News Author Ben Walpole M.ASCE",

The Association for Talent Development’s new research found that more than 75 percent of TD professionals believe that federal, state, and local government employees are facing a skills gap. Published Wed Apr 02 2025 Share LinkedIn Twitter Facebook [Alexandria, VA], April 2, 2025 —New research by the Association for Talent Development (ATD)revealed that 76 percent of talent development (TD) professionals think there is currently a skills gap in the government workforce and 78 percent expect a skills gap in the government workforce in the future. Government TD employees believe the top three skills lacking in the workforce include “managerial and supervisory, project management, and critical thinking,” according to ATD’s Bridging the Government Employee Skills Gap: Top Skills to Focus on Improving research report, sponsored by Cornerstone . About three-quarters of government TD professionals believe government employees will continue to experience a skills gap in the future, mostly in the areas of critical thinking, project management, and leadership. “Four in five federal TD employees expect there to be a future skills gap, and nearly 80 percent of local and state TD employees expect a future skills gap,” according to the report. Key findings from the report include: Seventy-two percent of government agencies are using live, instructor-led traditional classroom training to bridge skills gaps. Sixty-six percent of government agencies are using coaching to bridge skills gaps. Federal government agencies are more likely to use mentoring and rotation training programs than state and local agencies. “The report found that fewer than half of government agencies are assessing current gaps and creating plans to address their most critical needs,” the report said. ATD surveyed 227 talent development professionals (in September – December 2024) to discover the current and future skills gaps government agencies are facing. The report focuses on the top skills gaps that government agencies are currently facing and asks if they expect to continue facing them. The second part of the report highlights the methods government agencies are using to fill those gaps. ATD is hosting a free webinar about the report on April 17 at 2 p.m. ET. About ATD The Association for Talent Development (ATD) is the world’s largest professional membership organization supporting those who develop the knowledge and skills of employees, improve performance, and help to achieve results for the organizations they serve. Established in 1943, the association was previously known as the American Society for Training & Development (ASTD).

Continue Reading The advisory group emphasizes that businesses across industries must adapt skilling strategies to address both immediate and future talent challenges. The research, Dynamic Skilling: Anticipating and Mitigating Current and Future Skills Gaps , carried out in collaboration with Guild , the leading talent development company, highlights the need for a comprehensive learning ecosystem to support workforce-wide development. Organizations must provide diverse learning opportunities for all employees, including executives and leaders. Since some skills don't align to the learning objectives of traditional, structured programs, companies should incorporate microlearning, online courses, peer collaboration, knowledge management, talent marketplaces, educational programs, career pathways, and capability academies to enable large-scale re- and up-skilling in a rapidly evolving world. The report shows that a new approach is needed, where organizations subscribe to and support educational programs that effectively reskill and upskill frontline workers and professionals for future-proof careers while addressing known skills gaps. Recent research reveals that only 7% of companies are ready to anticipate these changing market dynamics and to reprioritize resources where they are needed most. These organizations outperform their peers–exceeding financial targets, driving faster innovation, and achieving higher productivity levels. The research, which features case studies from San Francisco -based solar and energy services company Sunrun and Colorado -based nonprofit healthcare provider UCHealth, highlights real-world examples of dynamic skilling adoption. Both organizations took holistic approaches to workforce development, demonstrating the evolution toward more adaptive and comprehensive skilling strategies. As highlighted in the report, Sunrun addressed skill visibility, electrician shortages, and leadership needs post-merger with a fully funded upskilling program through Guild offering career-aligned programs. This reduced turnover of hourly employees by 70%, boosted internal mobility (2.4x more job changes), and lowered operational costs. Guild partner UCHealth offers 250 programs, from high school completion to full degrees, enrolling nearly 1,000 employees in months to close skill gaps and strengthen its leadership in healthcare and communities. The Josh Bersin Company urges organizations to build on these foundations by investing in frontline skills, leadership, AI, and technical certifications, while also dedicating resources to analyze employee skills, job tasks, and market skills to identify current capabilities and better predict future workforce needs. PNC is an example of how investments in talent development and workforce planning can help businesses ensure education and training programs address skills gaps and better align with career pathways within the organization. Other companies like Tesla demonstrate how strategic educational investments close skills gaps, enhance workforce capabilities, and prepare employees for future industry demands. Companies aiming to address skills challenges should, therefore: Regularly review and prioritize skill needs in alignment with business goals. The fast-changing nature of work demands continuous reassessment to stay competitive in today's global market. Invest strategically in developing high-impact skills. Direct funding toward areas with the greatest business value to align employee growth with organizational priorities and measurable business outcomes. Measure the effectiveness of skill-building efforts and refine strategies as needed. A skills-based approach focused on solving key business challenges drives the highest returns. Integrate multiple skilling approaches. Different workforce segments require tailored skilling solutions—lay the groundwork now to create and sustain an agile learning culture, while fostering continuous innovation and resilience. Bijal Shah , CEO of Guild, says: \"Guild is proud to partner with innovative leaders like Sunrun and UCHealth, who are proving that investing in employee learning isn't just the right thing to do—it makes businesses stronger. \"Yet, most companies are unprepared for the future. Only 23% feel ready to adapt and stay competitive.

      "extracted_content": "Closing the digital skill divide would generate significant, measurable economic payoff for workers, businesses, and the broader economy. WASHINGTON, DC – February 6, 2023 – Today, National Skills Coalition (NSC) in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta released Closing the Digital Skill Divide , a real-time snapshot of demand for digital skills in the US labor market. The analysis finds that 92% of jobs analyzed require digital skills. Previous NSC research found one-third of workers don’t have the foundational digital skills necessary to enter and thrive in today’s jobs. Together, these findings point to a significant digital skill divide. The new report also found that public investments in closing this digital skill divide can generate measurable economic payoff for businesses, workers, and the broader economy. The report finds strong demand for digital skills across every industry (dispelling misconceptions that demand exists primarily in the tech sector) and in almost every occupation, including entry-level and frontline positions. The report also finds that the digital skill divide disproportionately impacts workers of color, low-income individuals, and rural residents, due to historic underinvestment and structural inequities. The findings come at a pivotal moment as states plan to implement the historic $2.75 billion Digital Equity Act, part of the bi-partisan infrastructure law. The program provides funding to advance digital equity among populations most impacted by the digital divide. The findings suggest that states that target resources toward digital skill building could generate measurable monetary benefits: Workers that qualify for jobs that require even one digital skill can earn an average of 23 percent more than in a job requiring no digital skills. Moving from a job requiring no digital skills to one requiring at least three can increase pay by an average of 45%. For the economy as a whole, these increased earnings could generate more state and federal tax revenue. Depending on the household size and composition, this could range from $1,363 to $2,879 in additional tax revenue per household per year. For businesses, turnover costs (estimated at $25,000 when a worker quits within the first year to over $78,000 after five years) can be averted or delayed by ensuring that workers have upskilling opportunities. “State policymakers are asking a lot of questions about how to most effectively target new federal resources to close the digital divide. With this groundbreaking research, any question about whether digital skills are as important as broadband and devices has now been answered,” said Andy Van Kleunen, National Skills Coalition CEO. “This report drives home that access to digital skill building is essential to advancing equity, opportunity, and economic growth.” “This research shows how fundamental and foundational digital skills have become in the labor market,” said Sarah Miller, Principal Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. “ These are critical skills the workforce needs to have now and into the future. Policymakers and program administrators should view digital skill development as baseline as digital access to ensure economic mobility for the communities and workers they are serving.” Over the next year, National Skills Coalition will work with policymakers, its member state coalitions, and corporate partner Comcast NBCUniversal to ensure more local and national leaders are aware of and take advantage of public sector digital equity funds to invest in the skill development programs that are critical to closing the digital divide. “We’re proud to partner with the National Skills Coalition and drive deeper awareness of the digital skills gap that we have long invested in helping to close,” said Broderick Johnson, Executive Vice President, Public Policy & Executive Vice President, Digital Equity for Comcast. “The data is clear. Both fundamental and industry-specific digital skills are vital to individual economic mobility as well as the continued competitiveness of our nation’s economy. To address this critical challenge, policymakers at every level must commit public funds to training the workforce of today and tomorrow in partnership with nonprofits and corporations alike.” While the report focused on national data, it found that demand for digital skills is high in every state and analyzed extensive data for two states – North Carolina and Illinois – as examples. “Ninety percent of jobs in Illinois require digital skills,” said Juan Salgado, Chancellor for City Colleges of Chicago. “Many of our students are able to balance work, parenting, and education because they are choosing online learning, which also requires a high level of digital literacy. This report unequivocally demonstrates that digital skill building has a direct economic impact on students, families, businesses, and the community as a whole.” The data analysis for the report was carried out as a joint project between NSC and the Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The research team analyzed 43 million online job postings published in 2021 collected by Lightcast (formerly known as Emsi/ Burning Glass Technologies). ### About National Skills Coalition: National Skills Coalition fights for inclusive, high-quality skills training so that people have access to a better life, and local businesses see sustained growth.

      "extracted_content": "ARLINGTON, Va., January 21, 2025 – Meals on Wheels America President and CEO Ellie Hollander today issued the following statement regarding the possible elimination of the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) program as one of the federal spending cut options recently circulated among House Budget Committee Members. Meals on Wheels America is deeply concerned about proposed spending cuts that, if enacted, would have a devastating impact on vulnerable older adults who rely on Meals on Wheels providers funded by the SSBG program for nutrition and other services. Many community-based Meals on Wheels providers depend on SSBG funding to bridge the growing shortfalls in other funding sources that have not kept pace with the growing population of older adults in need and rising operational costs. The menu of cost-saving measures reportedly circulated by House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (TX-19) also included significant cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that would harmfully impact older Americans. In 2024, Meals on Wheels providers in 37 states relied on SSBG funds to deliver nutritious meals and social connection to older adults. For some providers, SSBG funds are the only federal support they receive and the single largest funding source that enables them to serve older adults and individuals with disabilities in their communities. For example, Meals on Wheels Plus, Inc., which serves 1,738 clients in Abilene, TX and an additional 14 small rural communities across five counties in central Texas, depends on SSBG funds for nearly half of its total budget. This organization does not receive any other federal dollars and experienced a significant funding shortfall last year, with SSBG funds covering meals for only one thousand of their clients – leaving three hundred individuals on a waitlist to receive critical services. Elimination of SSBG funding would not only be catastrophic for Meals on Wheels Plus and the older adults they serve, but for impacted Meals on Wheels providers across the country. It is worth noting that SSBG funds support other vital community programs that benefit older adults, such as day care, foster care services and protective services. While the SSBG program is one of the smallest expenditures on the list of options for spending cuts, it is an effective program that makes an enormous difference in the lives of the people it serves. Eliminating or cutting the SSBG program would mean that more older adults may be hospitalized or put into nursing homes – at significantly greater cost to the federal government – because they are not getting the nutrition and human connection they need to remain healthy at home. Meals on Wheels is a valuable public-private partnership that, through a relatively modest federal investment, stands out as a proven and effective solution to senior hunger and social isolation that reduces other long-term governmental costs. Though annual appropriations for the Older Americans Act (OAA) Nutrition Program provide the primary federal funding for the Meals on Wheels network, other state and local sources and federal block grants like the SSBG provide additional funding that helps fill resource gaps for local providers. At a time when federal funding for the OAA Nutrition Program has not kept pace with either growing need or rising costs, eliminating SSBG funds would put further strain on community-based organizations that are already stretched too thin. This would directly compound existing challenges around unmet need and could force some organizations to introduce or expand waitlists or even shutter operations altogether. We cannot keep asking Meals on Wheels providers to do more with less. The devastating impact on vulnerable older adults and ramifications for our nation are of grave concern. Now is the time to End the Wait™ by tackling growing wait lists for meals and services and ensuring that every senior who needs Meals on Wheels gets it. Meals on Wheels America urges Congress and the Administration to reject any proposal that includes the elimination of or cuts to the SSBG program, or any other program that contributes to the health and well-being of America’s seniors. ### ABOUT MEALS ON WHEELS AMERICA Meals on Wheels America is the leadership organization supporting the more than 5,000 community-based programs across the country that are dedicated to addressing senior hunger and isolation. This network serves virtually every community in America and, along with more than two million staff and volunteers, delivers the nutritious meals, friendly visits and safety checks that enable America’s seniors to live nourished lives with independence and dignity.

      "extracted_content": "Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Cognitive psychology is proposing a functional model to explain the mental organisation leading to emotional disorders. Among these disorders, anxiety spectrum represents a domain in which this model seems to be interesting for an efficient and comprehensive approach of the pathology. Number of behavioral or cognitive psychotherapeutic methods are relating to these cognitive references, but the theorical concepts of cognitive \"shemata\" or cognitive \"processes\" evoked to describe mental functioning in anxiety need an experimental approach for a better rational understanding. Cognitive function as perception, attention or memory can be explored in this domaine in an efficient way, allowing a more precise study of each stage of information processing. The cognitive model proposed in the psychopathology of anxiety suggests that anxious subjects are characterized by biases in processing of emotionally valenced information. This hypothesis suggests functional interference in information processing in these subjects, leading to an anxious response to the most of different stimuli. Experimental approach permit to explore this hypothesis, using many tasks for testing different cognitive dysfunction evoked in the anxious cognitive organisation. Impairments revealed in anxiety disorders seem to result from specific biases in threat-related information processing, involving several stages of cognitive processes. Semantic interference, attentional bias, implicit memory bias and priming effect are the most often disorders observed in anxious pathology, like simple phobia, generalised anxiety, panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. These results suggest a top-down organisation of information processing in anxious subjects, who tend to detect, perceive and label many situations as threatening experience. The processes of reasoning and elaboration are consequently impaired in their adaptative function to threat, leading to the anxious response observed in clinical condition. The cognitive, behavioral and emotional components of this anxious reaction maintain the stressful experience for the subject, in which the self cognitive competence remain pathologically decreased. Cognitive psychology proposes an interesting model for the understanding of anxiety, in a domain in which subjectivity could benefit from an experimental approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) PubMed Disclaimer Publication types Review Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search MeSH terms Anxiety Disorders / psychology Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search Anxiety Disorders / therapy* Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search Arousal Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search Association Learning Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search Attention Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search Cognitive Behavioral Therapy / methods* Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search Humans Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search Mental Recall Actions Search in PubMed Search in MeSH Add to Search LinkOut - more resources Medical MedlinePlus Consumer Health Information MedlinePlus Health Information",

Protocol ID 07112001326, NCT ID: NCT00539903 Introduction Lack of moderate- to vigorous- -intensity physical activity (MVPA) is associated with a higher all-cause mortality [ 1 ] and increased risk of developing coronary heart disease [ 2 ], type 2 diabetes (T2D) [ 3 ], and the metabolic syndrome [ 4 ]. A physically active lifestyle seems to be protective [ 5 – 11 ]. For example, in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, participants who walked for an average of 2.5 h∙week -1 were 63% to 69% less likely to develop T2D than those who walked < 1 h∙week -1 [ 12 ]. A follow-up study of the participants in Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study showed that the relatively brief but resource-demanding intervention reduced the incidence of T2D (relative risk reduction of 36%) many years after the intervention programme [ 13 ]. Adherence to a physically active lifestyle over the long term is essential to derive sustainable health effects. However, developing interventions where the physical activity (PA) behaviour is maintained over the long term has proven challenging. Fewer than half of those who initiate any type of PA regimen will not continue the behaviour [ 14 ], and when interventionists and the incentives they provide are no longer available, PA tends to decline with time [ 14 ]. Interventions may be more successful at inducing sustained behaviour change if they involve strategies of behaviour modification [ 14 ]. Social cognitive theory (SCT) [ 15 ] is acknowledged as one of the leading behaviour change theories to explain and predict PA in the general population [ 16 , 17 ] and in those with T2D [ 18 ]. The central tenet of SCT is self-efficacy (i.e., confidence to perform the behaviour), which has been consistently and positively associated with PA [ 19 ]. Another major SCT construct is outcome expectancies (i.e., the person must value the outcomes that he/she believes will occur and that these positive outcomes outweigh any negative outcomes that might also be experienced). Other SCT constructs include the physical environment, the social environment, behavioural capability, and personal regulation. PA interventions targeting these constructs may use strategies such as providing PA opportunities, social support, and skills training; identifying PA outcomes with functional meaning; and observational learning, rewards and incentives, goal setting, problem solving, and self-reward [ 20 ]. The Physical Activity and Minority Health (PAMH) study was a five month SCT based PA programme for sedentary Pakistani immigrant men living in Norway. The low levels of PA among south Asian immigrants (which includes those from Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh) in Western countries [ 21 – 28 ] are likely to contribute to the high prevalence of T2D and CVD [ 21 , 22 , 29 – 36 ]. To our knowledge, only a few interventions have aimed at improving the PA level in south Asian immigrant men residing in Western countries, but none of these have reported on the long-term effects of the intervention [ 37 ]. In addition only one of these had a randomised controlled design [ 38 ]. This latter study was however, not designed to test the effect of a behaviour change program on the PA behaviour, but rather to test the effect of a structured exercise program over 12 weeks on insulin sensitivity. Also, few interventions have considered the relevance of SCT constructs to the PA behaviour of this group. As reported previously, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the intervention found positive short-term improvements (immediately after the intervention; follow-up 1 (FU1)) in PA level and accompanying beneficial changes in insulin sensitivity and waist circumference ([ 39 ] in press). The aims of the current study were: 1) to determine if the intervention produced long-term (six months after the intervention; follow-up 2 (FU2)) positive effects on PA level, and 2) to identify the social cognitive mediators of any intervention effects. Methods The design, the intervention programme and methods of the PAMH study have been described in detail previously ([ 39 ] in press), a short description is given below. The study protocol was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics (ref. no. S-07300b) and the Norwegian Social Science Data Services (ref. no. 17212/2/KS). All participants gave written informed consent. Participants For the original RCT, 150 participants, recruited through mosques and Muslim festivals, were randomised to either an intervention group or a control group at the baseline visit using a computer-generated list of random numbers. Pakistani (either born in Pakistan or parents born in Pakistan) immigrant men living in Oslo, Norway who were aged 25 to 60 years and who were not too physically active (i.e., they were excluded if they were exercising more than twice a week at a moderate or higher intensity for ≥ 30 min or cycling or walking to work most days of the week) were eligible for inclusion. Participants were not eligible if they had diabetes, did not speak Norwegian or had a severe injury. Seventeen participants were lost to FU1. Six months after the intervention ended, we telephoned all those who had attended FU1 and invited them to the FU2 (n = 133). Three participants declined, leaving 130 participants in the FU2 study.

      "extracted_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Huntington's disease (HD) and eight additional inherited neurological disorders are caused by CAG triplet-repeat expansions leading to expanded polyglutamine-sequences in their respective proteins. These triplet-CAG repeat disorders have in common the formation of aberrant intraneuronal proteinaceous inclusions containing the expanded polyglutamine sequences. These aggregates have been postulated to contribute to pathogenesis caused by conformational toxicity, sequestration of other polyglutamine-containing proteins, or by interfering with certain enzymatic activities. Testing these hypotheses has been hampered by the difficulty to isolate these aggregates from brain. Here we report that polyglutamine aggregates can be isolated from the brain of the Tet/HD94 conditional mouse model of HD, by following a method based on high salt buffer homogenization, nonionic detergent extraction, and gradient fractionation. We then verified that the method can be successfully applied to postmortem HD brains. Immunoelectron microscopy, both in human and mouse samples, revealed that the stable component of the inclusions are mutant huntingtin-containing and ubiquitin-containing fibrils. Atomic-force microscopy revealed that these fibrils have a \"beads on a string\" morphology. Thus, they resemble the in vitro assembled filaments made of recombinant mutant-huntingtin, as well as the Abeta and alpha-synuclein amyloid protofibrils. Finally, by shutting down transgene expression in the Tet/HD94 conditional mouse model of HD, we were able to demonstrate that these filaments, although stable in vitro, are susceptible to revert in vivo, thus demonstrating that the previously reported reversal of ubiquitin-immunoreactive inclusions does not simply reflect disassembling of the inclusions into their constituent fibrils and suggesting that any associated conformational or protein-sequestration toxicity is also likely to revert.

The patterns of racial disparities in health suggest that there are multiple ways by which racism can affect health. Perceived discrimination is one such pathway and the paper reviews the published research on discrimination and health that appeared in PubMed between 2005 and 2007. This recent research continues to document an inverse association between discrimination and health. This pattern is now evident in a wider range of contexts and for a broader array of outcomes. Advancing our understanding of the relationship between perceived discrimination and health will require more attention to situating discrimination within the context of other health-relevant aspects of racism, measuring it comprehensively and accurately, assessing its stressful dimensions, and identifying the mechanisms that link discrimination to health.

This paper will provide an overview of the current evidence for and needed research on the role of perceived discrimination in health. It seeks to situate the research on personal experiences of discrimination within the larger literature on racism and health. It begins by describing some salient patterns in the large and persistent racial/ethnic variations in health that have provided an impetus to better understand the role of racism in health. It centrally focuses on recent research on perceived discrimination and health. It critiques the existing literature with an eye toward highlighting the needed improvements in the conceptualization and measurement of perceived discrimination that would advance our understanding of the potential role of race-related stressors in health. Disparities and the added burden of race Racial disparities in health in the U.S. are large and pervasive. For most of the 15 leading causes of death including heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, hypertension, liver cirrhosis and homicide, African Americans (or blacks) have higher death rates than whites (Kung et al. 2008 ). These elevated death rates exist across the life-course with African Americans and American Indians having higher age-specific mortality rates than whites from birth through the retirement years (Williams 2005 ). Other data indicate that almost 100,000 black persons die prematurely each year who would not die if there were no racial disparities in health (Levine et al. 2001 ). Another noteworthy characteristic of racial disparities is their persistence over time. Despite gains in life expectancy for both blacks and whites, the 7 year racial gap in life expectancy in 1960 was still 5.1 years in 2005 (National Center for Health Statistics ( 2007 ). Similarly, although infant mortality has declined over time for both blacks and whites, the relative gap between the races is much wider today than it was in 1950 (Williams and Jackson 2005 ; NCHS 2007 ). For some health outcomes, the disparities are worsening. Trend data for heart disease and cancer—the two leading causes of death in the United States—indicate that blacks and whites had comparable death rates for these conditions in 1950, but African Americans now have higher mortality rates than whites (Williams and Jackson 2005 ; NCHS 2007 ). Research also reveals that pathogenic factors linked to race continue to affect health even when socioeconomic status (SES) is controlled. In national data there are residual racial differences in health at every level of SES for multiple indicators of health status, including self-rated health, heart disease mortality, hypertension and obesity (Pamuk et al. 1998 ). This pattern exists for a broad range of other outcomes. A striking example comes from national data on infant mortality by mothers’ education for all women age 20 years and older. African American women with a college degree or more education have a higher rate of infant mortality than white, Hispanic (or Latino), and Asian and Pacific Islander women who have not completed high school (Pamuk et al. 1998 ). Further evidence of the markedly elevated disease risk for African Americans comes from national data on chronic disease risk factors for blacks, whites and Hispanics age 40 and over (Crimmins et al. 2007 ). This study assessed indicators of blood pressure risk (systolic, diastolic, and pulse rate), inflammation risk (C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, albumin) and metabolic risk (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, BMI and glycated hemoglobin). A summary indicator of total risk counted how many of these 10 risk factors were outside of the normal range. This study found that even after adjustment for income, education, gender and age, blacks had higher scores on blood pressure, inflammation, and total risk. Importantly, blacks maintained a higher risk profile even after adjusting for health behaviors (smoking, poor diet, physical activity and access to care). These data suggest that there are added factors linked to racial status that adversely affect the health of disadvantaged minority populations in the United States. In seeking to understand these striking burdens of race, researchers are pursuing three lines of inquiry. First, the measures of SES are not equivalent across race. For example, compared to whites, college-educated blacks are more likely to experience unemployment, employed blacks are more likely to be exposed to occupational hazards and carcinogens even after adjusting for job experience and education, blacks have lower wealth at every level of income, and have less purchasing power because the costs of a broad range of goods and services are higher in Black communities (Kaufman et al. 1997 ; Williams and Collins 1995 ). Second, there is increasing attention to the need to capture exposure to health risks over the life course. Racial/ethnic differences in childhood SES and early life psychosocial and economic adversity are likely to be important contributors to racial disparities in adult health. Third, researchers are exploring the multiple ways by which racism can adversely affect health (Jones 2000 ; Williams 2004 ; Ahmed et al. 2007 ). Perceived discrimination as a stressor The term, racism, refers to an organized system that categorizes population groups into ‘races’, and uses this ranking to preferentially allocate societal goods and resources to groups regarded as superior (Bonilla-Silva 1996 ). Fundamental to racism is cultural racism that undergirds an ideology of inferiority that ranks some racial groups as inherently or culturally superior to others and supports the social norms and institutions that implement this ideology (Jones 1997 ). Racism often leads to the development of negative attitudes and beliefs toward racial outgroups (prejudice), and differential treatment of members of these groups by both individuals and social institutions (discrimination). Importantly, because racism is deeply embedded in the culture and institutions of society, discrimination can persist in institutional structures and policies even in the context of marked declines in individual level racial prejudice and discrimination. Moreover, negative racial stereotypes that are ",

This hypothesis is based, in part, on the belief that the 20s through early 30s constitute \"prime\" childbearing ages that are low-risk relative to younger or older ages. However, when stratified by racial identification over the predominant first child-bearing ages, maternal age patterns of neonatal mortality vary between groups. Unlike non-Hispanic white infants, African-American infants with teen mothers experience a survival advantage relative to infants whose mothers are older. The black-white infant mortality differential is larger at older maternal ages than at younger ages. While African Americans and non-Hispanic whites differ on which maternal ages are associated with the lowest risk of neonatal mortality, within each population, first births are most frequent at its lowest-risk maternal ages. As a possible explanation for racial variation in maternal age patterns of births and birth outcomes, the \"weathering hypothesis\" is proposed: namely, that the health of African-American women may begin to deteriorate in early adulthood as a physical consequence of cumulative socioeconomic disadvantage.

To remedy this shortcoming, in this paper I look at the differences in people's online skills. In order to measure online ability, I assigned search tasks to a random sample of Internet users from a suburban county in the United States. My findings suggest that people search for content in a myriad of ways and there is considerable difference in whether individuals are able to find various types of content on the Web and a large variance in how long it takes to complete online tasks. Age is negatively associated with one's level of Internet skill, experience with the technology is positively related to online skill, and differences in gender do little to explain the variance in the ability of different people to find content online.

Many predict that by the end of this century water will dominate world natural resources politics as oil does today. Access to water is widely regarded as a basic human right, and was declared so by the United Nations in 1992. And yet the water crisis grows: although the total volume of water on the planet may be sufficient for our needs, much of it is misallocated, wasted, or polluted, and the poorest of the poor live in arid areas where water is scarce. The coming decade will require new perspectives on water resources and reconsideration of the principles of water governance and policy. W ater, Place, and Equity argues that fairness in the allocation of water will be a cornerstone to a more equitable ands secure future for humankind. With analyses and case studies, it demonstrates that considerations of equity are more important in formulating and evaluating water policy than the more commonly invoked notions of efficiency and markets. The case studies through which the book explores issues of water equity range from cost and benefit disparities that result from Southern California's storm water runoff policies to the privatization of water in Bolivia. In a final chapter, Water, Place, and Equity considers broader concerns—the impact of global climate change on water resources and better ways to incorporate equity into future water policy.

The topic is framed as part of the general issue of health disparities, which involves the oft-observed positive relationship between SES and the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical well-being of adults and children. A review of recent research and theory identifies three general theoretical approaches that provide possible explanations for the association between SES and individual development: the social causation, social selection, and interactionist perspectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates support for the social causation view that SES affects families and the development of children in terms of both family stress processes (the family stress model) and family investments in children (the family investment model). However, there also is empirical support for the social selection argument that individual characteristics lead to differences in SES. Especially important, recent research is consistent with an interactionist approach, which proposes a dynamic relationship between SES and developmental change over time. Drawing on the combined set of research findings, the article concludes with the description of an interactionist model that serves as a heuristic for future studies of the links among SES, parenting behaviors, and child development.",

Several ways of measuring SES have been proposed, but most include some quantification of family income, parental education, and occupational status. Research shows that SES is associated with a wide array of health, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes in children, with effects beginning prior to birth and continuing into adulthood. A variety of mechanisms linking SES to child well-being have been proposed, with most involving differences in access to material and social resources or reactions to stress-inducing conditions by both the children themselves and their parents. For children, SES impacts well-being at multiple levels, including both family and neighborhood. Its effects are moderated by children's own characteristics, family characteristics, and external support systems.",

This paper reviews research regarding family stress frameworks to model the pathways from economic disadvantage to negative child outcomes via family processes. Future research in this area should expand definitions of family and household to incorporate diversity and instability. This expansion would be particularly relevant for research among low-income ethnic minority families and families with young children. This line of research would highlight specific pathways to target to prevent the onset of early parental and child dysfunction. Keywords: economic disadvantage, poverty, parenting, family processes, early childhood Child poverty is a persistent critical problem in the United States. In 2006, almost 17% of children (approximately 13 million) in the United States were poor ( National Center for Children in Poverty, 2008 ). Young children face the highest poverty rates, as 20% of children under age 6 in the United States live in families living below the poverty level ( National Center for Children in Poverty, 2008 ). Poverty constitutes a pervasive developmental hazard that exposes families and children to multiple sources of risks at it works in concert with individual, family and sociocultural characteristics to create an ecology in which child development unfolds. The main effects of poverty or low-income are difficult to isolate because economic disadvantage is associated with a host of other disadvantages that threaten child development. Often the goal of developmental scientists studying poverty is to identify mediators that account for the effects of poverty on children. Family process or family stress models have examined the family-based mechanisms through which poverty influences children, often focusing on parenting behaviors and parent-child relationships. It has been well-established in the extant literature that growing up in poverty places children at risk for multiple socioemotional disadvantages. Economic adversity has been linked to a wide range of negative child outcomes, including elevated risks for insecure attachment relationships ( Lyons-Ruth et al., 1997 ), psychosocial morbidity ( Costello, Keeler & Angold, 2001 ; Evans & English, 2002 ), behavior problems ( Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997 ; Evans & English, 2001 ; Hanson, McLanahan & Thomson, 1997 ), reduced social competence ( Bolger et al., 1995 ), lower-levels of self-regulation ( Brody & Flor, 1997 ; Evans & English, 2002 ) and elevated physiological markers of stress ( Evans & English, 2002 ). Research has aimed to identify the mechanisms that link poverty to these disadvantages in order to identify targets for effective interventions and policies. The family is a crucial system in which to explore how economic disadvantage impacts young children. This paper begins by reviewing the large body of research focusing on family stress or process models that explore family-based pathways through which economic disadvantage is associated with negative child outcomes. This work has fundamentally advanced the field, and it is crucial to the development of effective programs and policies for poor families. This paper highlights the importance of expanding these models to incorporate broad and flexible definitions of family and to account explicitly for instability in family, household and relationship structures. These expanded lines of research are particularly relevant to studying young children and racial/ethnic minority families. Ultimately, these complex and dynamic models may lead to the development of ecologically grounded research and subsequent targeted interventions for poor families with young children. Family Stress Models Family stress models describing the processes through which poverty influences child development have gained wide acceptance. Early family stress models grew out of the seminal work of Glen Elder ( Elder et al., 1985 ; Elder, 1996 ) who studied the influence of economic loss during the Great Depression on paternal behaviors and child outcomes. Rand Conger’s ( Conger & Conger, 2002 ; Conger et al., 1992 ; Conger et al., 1993 ) research group studying Iowa farm communities experiencing economic downturns in the 1980’s further supported and expanded upon Elder’s work. The primary tenet of family stress models holds that economic disadvantage triggers feelings of economic pressure, which in turn lead to psychological distress in parents that ultimately negatively impacts child development through two different reciprocal pathways. A large body of research has demonstrated the robust relationship between psychological distress, especially depression, frustration, anxiety and anger, emotion states associated consistently with poverty and/or economic loss, and less sensitive, nurturing, responsive parenting ( Aber, Jones & Cohen, 2000 ; Magnuson & Duncan, 2002 ; McLeod & Shanahan, 1993 ; McLoyd, 1998 ; Petterson & Albers, 2001 ). Some studies take a more family-systems oriented perspective by considering the role of marital/partner conflict within economically disadvantaged families. In these models, economic pressure and psychological distress are linked to conflict in the marital system, which may in turn negatively impact parenting and child behavior. The bi-directional relationship between stress and marital conflict is central, as both marital conflict and psychological distress are independently associated with negative parenting behavior. As will be discussed later, this concept of marital conflict should be expanded beyond the marital or parental dyad to include more relationships between adults playing significant roles in children’s lives. Economic Disadvantage There are multiple ways to conceptualize economic disadvantage. Traditional family stress models suggest that perception of financial strain mediates the relationship between income and psychological distress. In other words, the subjective experience of economic disadvantage is proposed to have a greater influence on parenting and child outcomes than the objective experience of being poor ( Conger & Donellan, 2007 ; McLoyd et al., 1994 ; Mistry et al., 2004 ). Measures of financial strain introduce an individual level variable by tapping the parents’ perceptions of financial problems. Accordingly, there should be considerable individual variability of financial strain levels within a single income bracket that is likely to be influenced by other family and individual factors, including social support, parental mental health and cultural beliefs. Furthermore, differences in resources, opportunities, and perceptions or casual attributions of economic loss or disadvantage may influence the impact of financial strain on parental functioning and parenting behaviors ( Beiser et al., 2002 ; Elder et al., 1995 ; McLoyd, 1990 ). Another common approach to studying economic disadvantage is direct measurement of household income. Poverty is often measured according to the cash income guidelines established by the federal poverty threshold. Many studies measure family income and then determine the percentage ab",

The eight different questionnaires were administered to random subsamples of six “targeted” populations: geographic areas with ethnic concentrations of whites, blacks, American Indians, Alaskan natives, Asian and Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics. The major conclusion is that allowing multiple responses to the “race” question in the 2000 census (and other variations in measurement that were considered in RAETT) had only a slight impact on the measured racial composition of the population. Another finding was a dramatic reduction in nonresponse to the combined race/Hispanic-origin question relative to all other questionnaire formats. We conclude that the concept of “origins” may be closer to the popular understanding of American diversity than is the antiquated concept of race.

Bunch 2 Samantha Basch 1 Sam R. McHugh 1 Salvador Huitzilopochtli 2 Maureen Callanan 1 1 Department of Psychology, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, United States 2 Department of Education, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, United States Despite decades of efforts, deficit narratives regarding language development and use by children and students from historically marginalized backgrounds remain persistent in the United States. Examining selective literature, we discuss the ideologies that undergird two deficit narratives: the notion that some children have a “word gap” when compared to their White middle-class peers, and students must develop “academic language” to engage in rigorous content learning. The “word gap” concept came from a study wherein a group of young children in low-income families heard fewer words than those in middle-class families. It assumes that language can only be acquired in one way—vocabulary exchange from one parent to one child—and ignores decades of research on diverse pathways for language development. We highlight an alternative perspective that language development builds on children’s experience with cultural practices and the harm on minoritized children by privileging a specific form of vocabulary acquisition. The second deficit narrative concerns “academic language,” a concept championed by scholars aiming to address educational inequity. The construct runs the risk of undervaluing the potential of students from historically marginalized backgrounds to engage in learning using language that is “informal,” nonconventional, or “non-native like.” It also is sometimes used as a rationale to relegate students to special programs isolated from more rigorous academic discourse, thus ironically removing them from opportunities to develop the academic registers they are deemed to be missing. We explore alternative frameworks that shift the focus from linguistic features of academic talk and texts as prerequisites for academic work to the broad range of linguistic resources that students employ for academic purposes in the classroom. Finally, we turn to a positive approach to youths’ language development and use: translanguaging by multilingual learners and their teachers. Translanguaging demonstrates the power of a resource-oriented perspective that values students’ rich communicative repertoires and actively seeks to disrupt language hierarchies. We argue that this approach, however, must be considered in relation to the broader social context to meet its transformative aims. Together, our analysis suggests counter-possibilities to dismantle deficit-oriented narratives and points to promising directions for research and practices to reduce inequity in education. Despite decades of efforts to dismantle deficit perspectives on culturally and linguistically minoritized students in United States education, and a wealth of literature that has provided evidence to counter these perspectives, deficit narratives regarding students’ language development and language use remain persistent. Our goal in this paper is to focus on examples where deficit perspectives have taken hold, and to consider alternative approaches in those domains. We begin by contrasting deficit-based and strengths-based perspectives on language development and educational outcomes. We then consider the broader, and orthogonal, contrast between individual cognitive approaches to the study of language development versus more social-pragmatic contextual approaches. We explore three topics of studies where these different perspectives are particularly relevant. Deficit views involve a narrow focus on what students do not have or cannot do, derived from a long-lived perspective that attributes the failure of individuals to internal or presumed deficiencies of their families and communities. Deficit lenses are typical of research that examines “gaps” of different kinds, positioning individuals, rather than structural inequities, as the subjects of scrutiny. Valencia (2010) describes this process as identifying differences between groups, labeling them as causes, and then creating interventions as remedies. A hallmark of deficit approaches is their tendency to propose unidimensional, commonly-understood constructs or metaphors to explain educational failure: “[b]ased on the ‘law of parsimony,’ deficit thinking is a type of cognition that is a relatively simple and efficient form of attributing the ‘cause’ of human behavior .” ( Valencia, 2010 , p. 22, emphasis in original). By focusing narrowly on individuals, deficit thinking obscures structural factors, like school segregation, disinvestment, or tracking. This approach also ignores the potential harm done to minoritized populations by standards and curricula that ignore non-dominant disciplinary epistemologies, for example, the invention of mathematical “illiteracy” of Black students ( Martin, 2019 ) or the “settled expectations” that restrict the content and form of the science valued and communicated in science education ( Harris, 1995 ; Bang et al., 2012 ). When deficit thinking is applied in classroom settings, the results often include segregation of students who are viewed as inferior, and arguments about the educability of certain groups of students that rely on pseudoscientific beliefs in cultural or genetic deficits. Further, deficit views often are embedded in what Bourdieu and Nice (1977) described as defense of the doxa, or the deep unquestioned assumptions of a society (see also Valencia, 2010 ; Valdés, 2017 ). A good case in point for unquestioned assumptions (or doxa) that support deficit thinking is the notion of coloniality ( Quijano, 2000 ). Whereas coloniality is more fully described in a later section, it is important to introduce here the still-alive colonial idea that positions non-European people and cultural practices (which include language practices) as primitive and, therefore, deserving of their places within social hierarchies. These types of beliefs, which originated alongside colonial relationships of power, can remain unquestioned when we presume that students need to use privileged forms of English in order to engage with certain forms of intellectual work. As such, it is important to take issues of power and larger historical contexts into account when considering the role of cultural experience in language development as it manifests in educational settings. In contrast, scholars have explored a range of alternatives to “blaming the victim” ( Valencia, 2010 , p. 19) for understanding and addressing persistent inequalities in educational outcomes. Some have put the focus on inequalities in educational systems and broader social and economic structures , such as Valencia (2010) , who has argued for the importance of understanding how “racialized opportunity structures lead to racialized achievement patterns” (p. 21). Others have taken frameworks commonly used for explaining disadvantages facing racially and linguistically minoritized children and families to shine light on the unrecognized and undervalued resources that they possess. Yosso (2005) , for example, reexamines the notion of social, cultural, and linguistic “capital”—often used to highlight what minoritized people are missing—to instead explore the “community cultural wealth” that they bring. Such resources include particular kinds of cultural, linguistic, and social capital not held by dominant populations, but also aspirational, naviga",

      "extracted_content": "This powerful and disturbing book clearly links persistent poverty among blacks in the United States to the unparalleled degree of deliberate segregation they experience in American cities. American Apartheid shows how the black ghetto was created by whites during the first half of the twentieth century in order to isolate growing urban black populations. It goes on to show that, despite the Fair Housing Act of 1968, segregation is perpetuated today through an interlocking set of individual actions, institutional practices, and governmental policies. In some urban areas the degree of black segregation is so intense and occurs in so many dimensions simultaneously that it amounts to \"hypersegregation.\" The authors demonstrate that this systematic segregation of African Americans leads inexorably to the creation of underclass communities during periods of economic downturn. Under conditions of extreme segregation, any increase in the overall rate of black poverty yields a marked increase in the geographic concentration of indigence and the deterioration of social and economic conditions in black communities. As ghetto residents adapt to this increasingly harsh environment under a climate of racial isolation, they evolve attitudes, behaviors, and practices that further marginalize their neighborhoods and undermine their chances of success in mainstream American society. This book is a sober challenge to those who argue that race is of declining significance in the United States today. View More Praise A major contribution to our understanding of both racism and poverty... One hopes that the book will be read, not only by other scholars and policy analysts, but by a broad spectrum of citizens and by all the leaders of the nation. Richly documented ... A splendid book. American Apartheid explores a topic that many of us have come to take for granted, presents a fascinating array of data that have never been assembled in one place and compellingly argues that segregation is crucial to understanding what has happened to [urban] blacks. In the meticulousness of its research and the density of its arguments, [ American Apartheid ] stands well apart from even the best-argued and most amply documented books by journalists on racial problems. Essential reading for anyone interested in the causes, and possible cures, of urban poverty. An incredibly readable book that must be studied by all Americans—liberal and conservative, black and white. View More Authors Douglas S. Massey is Henry G.

Scientific American has served as an advocate for science and industry for 180 years, and right now may be the most critical moment in that two-century history. I’ve been a Scientific American subscriber since I was 12 years old, and it helped shape the way I look at the world. SciAm always educates and delights me, and inspires a sense of awe for our vast, beautiful universe. I hope it does that for you, too. If you subscribe to Scientific American , you help ensure that our coverage is centered on meaningful research and discovery; that we have the resources to report on the decisions that threaten labs across the U.S.; and that we support both budding and working scientists at a time when the value of science itself too often goes unrecognized. In return, you get essential news, captivating podcasts , brilliant infographics, can't-miss newsletters , must-watch videos, challenging games , and the science world's best writing and reporting. You can even gift someone a subscription . There has never been a more important time for us to stand up and show why science matters. I hope you’ll support us in that mission. Thank you, David M.

Office of Policy Planning and Research United States Department of Labor March 1965 Two hundred years ago, in 1765, nine assembled colonies first joined together to demand freedom from arbitrary power. For the first century we struggled to hold together the first continental union of democracy in the history of man. One hundred years ago, in 1865, following a terrible test of blood and fire, the compact of union was finally sealed. For a second century we labored to establish a unity of purpose and interest among the many groups which make up the American community. That struggle has often brought pain and violence. It is not yet over. State of the Union Message of President Lyndon B. Johnson, January 4, 1965. The United States is approaching a new crisis in race relations. In the decade that began with the school desegregation decision of the Supreme Court, and ended with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the demand of Negro Americans for full recognition of their civil rights was finally met. The effort, no matter how savage and brutal, of some State and local governments to thwart the exercise of those rights is doomed. The nation will not put up with it — least of all the Negroes. The present moment will pass. In the meantime, a new period is beginning. In this new period the expectations of the Negro Americans will go beyond civil rights. Being Americans, they will now expect that in the near future equal opportunities for them as a group will produce roughly equal results, as compared with other groups. This is not going to happen. Nor will it happen for generations to come unless a new and special effort is made. There are two reasons. First, the racist virus in the American blood stream still afflicts us: Negroes will encounter serious personal prejudice for at least another generation. Second, three centuries of sometimes unimaginable mistreatment have taken their toll on the Negro people. The harsh fact is that as a group, at the present time, in terms of ability to win out in the competitions of American life, they are not equal to most of those groups with which they will be competing. Individually, Negro Americans reach the highest peaks of achievement. But collectively, in the spectrum of American ethnic and religious and regional groups, where some get plenty and some get none, where some send eighty percent of their children to college and others pull them out of school at the 8th grade, Negroes are among the weakest. The most difficult fact for white Americans to understand is that in these terms the circumstances of the Negro American community in recent years has probably been getting worse, not better . Indices of dollars of income, standards of living, and years of education deceive. The gap between the Negro and most other groups in American society is widening. The fundamental problem, in which this is most clearly the case, is that of family structure. The evidence — not final, but powerfully persuasive — is that the Negro family in the urban ghettos is crumbling. A middle class group has managed to save itself, but for vast numbers of the unskilled, poorly educated city working class the fabric of conventional social relationships has all but disintegrated. There are indications that the situation may have been arrested in the past few years, but the general post war trend is unmistakable. So long as this situation persists, the cycle of poverty and disadvantage will continue to repeat itself. The thesis of this paper is that these events, in combination, confront the nation with a new kind of problem. Measures that have worked in the past, or would work for most groups in the present, will not work here. A national effort is required that will give a unity of purpose to the many activities of the Federal government in this area, directed to a new kind of national goal: the establishment of a stable Negro family structure. This would be a new departure for Federal policy. And a difficult one. But it almost certainly offers the only possibility of resolving in our time what is, after all, the nation's oldest, and most intransigent, and now its most dangerous social problem.

Introduction to Algorithms combines rigor and comprehensiveness. The book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth, yet makes their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor. The first edition became the standard reference for professionals and a widely used text in universities worldwide. The second edition features new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming, as well as extensive revisions to virtually every section of the book. In a subtle but important change, loop invariants are introduced early and used throughout the text to prove algorithm correctness. Without changing the mathematical and analytic focus, the authors have moved much of the mathematical foundations material from Part I to an appendix and have included additional motivational material at the beginning.

Virtual Inequality redefines the issue as it explores the cascades of that divide, which involve access, skill, political participation, as well as the obvious economics. Computer and Internet access are insufficient without the skill to use the technology, and economic opportunity and political participation provide primary justification for realizing that this inequality is a public problem and not simply a matter of private misfortune. Defying those who say the divide is growing smaller, this volume, based on a unique national survey that includes data from over 1800 respondents in low-income communities, shows otherwise. In addition to demonstrating why disparities persist in such areas as technological abilities, the survey also shows that the digitally disadvantaged often share many of the same beliefs as their more privileged counterparts. African-Americans, for instance, are even more positive in their attitudes toward technology than whites are in many respects, contrary to conventional wisdom. The rigorous research on which the conclusions are based is presented accessibly and in an easy-to-follow manner. Not content with analysis alone, nor the untangling of the complexities of policymaking, Virtual Inequality views the digital divide compassionately in its human dimensions and recommends a set of practical and common-sense policy strategies. Inequality, even in a virtual form this book reminds us, is unacceptable and a situation that society is compelled to address. Table of Contents Preface 1. Redefining the Digital Divide 2.

Beyond the Divides: Toward Opportunity and Equality Appendix 1: Multivariate Regression Tables Appendix 2: Survey Questionnaire Glossary References Index Reviews \"While government is digitally transforming the way in which it delivers services and communicates with citizens, this book reminds us that many are not likely to benefit from greater access to services, information, and government officials. The authors reconceptualize the information technology challenge facing society as a constellation of multiple divides involving access, skill, economic opportunity, and democratic political participation. Moreover, they draw on both a wealth of important data and rigorous analysis to demonstrate convincingly that persistent disparities in technology access and skill matter for economic opportunity and political participation, and that governments will have to fashion broader solutions to take full advantage of technology's social potential.\"—Jane E. Fountain, associate professor of public policy and director of the National Center for Digital Government, John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University \"Who should read Virtual Inequality ? Students, teachers, journalists, policy analysts, government decision makers, community leaders and especially ordinary citizens should read it. The authors provide a concise and clear beacon for seeing and understanding the so-called digital divide not simply as a measurement of the gaps between those who have ready access to PCs and Internet connectivity and those who don't. Instead, they present and explain a much bigger, more complex, critical set of problems and issues regarding how the allocation of information and knowledge, political power and opportunity is defining the evolving Information Society of the 21st Century. They caution that beyond the term digital divide are issues about quality of life, democracy, exclusion and who gets what, when and under what circumstances.\"—Nolan A.
