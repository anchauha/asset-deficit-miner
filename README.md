# asset-deficit-miner
A web application that performs real-time semantic analysis on user provided documents to classify asset vs deficit based language. A custom `BERT-base-uncased` model was fine-tuned for this specific task. The model's development involved a pipeline that first scraped web content to build a corpus, then used a Llama 3 70B model to programmatically label text spans as asset or deficit-framed, and finally used this generated dataset to train BERT classifier. The final analysis is presented through an interactive Flask interface featuring color-coded text highlighting and confidence scores.
